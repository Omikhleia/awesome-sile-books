### Booklet

The PDF booklet is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, Le Dragon de Brume.

Reproduction and/or distribution of the PDF or any derivative work in any form (including modified versions or printed copies) is allowed under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0, provided that the original source is clearly credited and that the work is not used for commercial purposes.

The core idea here is to show how SILE and the _re·sil·ient_ collection of modules were used to make that book a reality. It works as a "real-case" example, so that you may look at its sources and understand how we addressed our typesetting needs for that project.
