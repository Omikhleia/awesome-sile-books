## Note

The initial Summer 2024 edition was generated with a special build of SILE, derived from SILE 0.15 and an early port of the (at the time) in-development bibTeX and CSL modules.

The Winter 2024 edition was updated to work with SILE 0.15.9 and _re·sil·ient_ 2.7.0.

### Bibliography files

The bibliography files that were used to generate the booklet are available under CC-BY-SA 4.0 (CreativeCommons Attribution Share-Alike license). See the [dedicated README](../bibliographies/README.md) for more details.

### Booklet

The PDF booklet is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, Le Dragon de Brume.

Reproduction and/or distribution of the PDF or any derivative work in any form (including modified versions or printed copies) is allowed under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0, provided that the original source is clearly credited and that the work is not used for commercial purposes.

The core idea here is to show how SILE and the _re·sil·ient_ collection of modules were used to make that book a reality. It works as a "real-case" example, so that you may look at its sources and understand how we addressed our typesetting needs for that project.

## Contributions

By nature, a work like this may contain error, and be "incomplete".
As a "permanent edition", it is meant to be updated and corrected over time.

You are of course welcome, as stated in the introduction chapters, to report corrections or propose emendations and additions.
While you can do so by writing to the Dragon de Brume's email address, the best preferred is to post an "issue" on the project repository here.

For more advanced readers who do know what it means: proposing a PR is even possible and appreciated, but be sure to fist discuss it in an issue before submitting anything.
