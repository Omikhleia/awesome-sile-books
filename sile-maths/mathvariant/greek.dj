# Greek letters

There are even fewer variants for Greek letters: "normal", "bold", "italic", "bold-italic", "bold-sans-serif", "sans-serif-bold-italic".

In MathML you can get a bold $`\mi[mathvariant="bold"]{ω}` with `<mi mathvariant="bold">ω</mi>`.
The TeX-like syntax `\mi[mathvariant="bold"]{ω}` works, although the convenience `\mathbf{\omega}` is also available and gives the same result, $`\mathbf{\omega}`.
(Of course, you could have used the ω character directly, but since you are reading this with TeX-like math in mind, you'll probably also want to use an `\omega` macro here.)

Note that the Libertinus Math font used in this document lacks a few of the lowercase variants.
