In mathematical typesetting, "phantom" elements are placeholders that occupy space without displaying visible content.

In MathML, the `<mphantom>` element allows for the creation of invisible elements that match the dimensions of visible content.
This provides fine control over layout by reserving space as if the content were there, without actually rendering it. 
These phantom elements prove especially useful for aligning multi-line equations, balancing fractions, or creating consistent space around symbols.
