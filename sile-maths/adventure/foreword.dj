# Foreword

> "Grandpa, how did you end up on adventure in the perilous Land of Maths?"
>
> "Well, it all began with a simple, amusing task involving square roots, nth roots, and the like..."
>
> "And that went smoothly, didn't it?"
>
> "At first, yes. But then I started picking out random formulas, sure I could typeset anything that  came my way. Little did I know, I had wandered into the lair of the Hydra."
^ Grandpa's bedtime stories.

## Objective

This booklet showcases the advancements made in enhancing SILE's math engine up to version 0.15.7+,[^sile-version] along with a critical assessment of its current capabilities and the challenges it faces.[^booklet-sources-available]

[^sile-version]: Regarding SILE's versions, see p.\ [](#changelog-next-step){.page}.

[^booklet-sources-available]: All the source files for this booklet are available on our [_Awesome SILE Books_](https://github.com/Omikhleia/awesome-sile-books){custom-style=link} repository.

## Disclaimer

The views expressed in this booklet are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the SILE development team or the broader SILE community.
This is not an official publication of the SILE organization, and no claim is made that any of the personal views expressed are endorsed by the project.

While the critique may come across as provocative and opinionated, it is intended as a constructive evaluation, emphasizing areas for improvement and suggesting pathways for future development.
There is no intent to undermine the significant efforts of the SILE developers, who have created an impressive typesetting system supported by a vibrant community.

As a contributor to the SILE project, the author holds a vested interest in its continued success.

So read on, with an open mind and a critical eye, as we delve into the realm of mathematical typesetting with SILE.
The maths shall speak for themselves, and you are encouraged to explore the examples and draw your own conclusions.
