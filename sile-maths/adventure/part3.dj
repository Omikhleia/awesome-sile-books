## Liminary note

With plenty of test cases and formulas in hand, it's time to put SILE through its paces and see how it handles the challenges we have thrown at it.
Over the course of this work, we have implemented numerous improvements to enhance its handling of complex mathematical typesetting.
While progress has been substantial, some results remain less than perfect.

:::
The goal here is twofold: to assess how well SILE performs under varied and demanding scenarios, and to identify areas that still need refinement.
This process is as much about celebrating the strides made as it is about pinpointing the gaps that remain.
Let's see how far we've come -- and how much further we need to go.
