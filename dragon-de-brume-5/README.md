This folder contains the complete sources of _On some stars, flowers & places in Middle-earth,_ a 118-page collection of essays on the wonderful world of Middle-earth imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien.

For more details, see [the editor's website](https://sites.google.com/site/dragonbrumeux/on-some-stars-flowers-places-in-middle-earth).

## Note

The initial print edition was generated with a special build of SILE, derived from SILE 0.14.11 + [PR 1792](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile/pull/1792) (automated italic correction).

Copyrighted material © 2023, Le Dragon de Brume.

Le Dragon de Brume remains the sole owner of this material.

Reproduction and/or distribution of the PDF or any derivative work in any form (including modified versions or printed copies) is NOT allowed without proper authorization.

Nevertheless, the core idea here is to show how SILE and the _re·sil·ient_ collection of modules were used to make that book a reality. It works as a "real-case" example, so that you may look at its sources and understand how we addressed our typesetting needs for that project. Therefore, you may obviously build the PDF version of the book for yourself and keep a private copy.
