## Regarding Euler's $`e^{\mathrm{i}\pi} + 1 = 0`

Some people say $`e^{\mathrm{i}\pi} + 1 = 0` is one of the most beautiful equation in mathematics.

> But all I want to check here is that $`e^{\mathrm{i}\pi} + 1 = 0` honors the current document font size.[^euler]

[^euler]: And $`e^{\mathrm{i}\pi} + 1 = 0` in a footnote is even smaller.
