  At this juncture, should the truth not be unveiled?
  Alain Lefèvre{.smallcaps} is a fictional _persona,_ a composite pseudonym employed for essays conceived by a collective of minds.
  Initially, this pseudonym was assigned to articles that sprang from various individuals during discussions, yet were crystallized into written form by a singular person, taking on the responsibility of the redaction.

  The editor in question was hesitant to affix his own name to these articles, even with an _et al._ acknowledgment.
  Although he primarily undertook the redaction, the ideas were a product of collaborative endeavor. Thus, Alain Lefèvre (Alan "the Smith") was born.
  Liberated from the bounds of constraint, he developed a distinctive style and a semblance of personality. Alain became a companion in our journey, and more hands joined in his writings.
  The revelation might mark the end of this pseudonymous existence, but Alain lives on within the pages of the books published by Le Dragon de Brume.
  In a sense, he has now taken on a life of his own.
