[^main-note-shire-carto]: This essay was initially published in French in _Tolkien, le façonnement d’un monde,_ vol.\ 2, Le Dragon de Brume, 2014, pp.\ 231--270. The present version has been revised and augmented by the author.


[O]{custom-style="initial-joined"}[n the occasion]{.smallcaps} of the 120th anniversary of Tolkien's birth in 2012, I worked with Le Dragon de Brume on a comprehensive overview of the mapping of the Shire.
At that time, there was no such essay in French.
Previous publications by Pierre Jourde, Vincent Ferré, or others addressed the cartography of Middle-earth from a general perspective, without dwelling on the history and specificities of the small map of the Shire in _The Lord of the Rings._

Time has passed.
Over the past twelve years, J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional cartography has been enriched by the unveiling of valuable material, shedding new illumination on his imaginative world.
In 2015, the public discovered a map of Middle-earth annotated by Tolkien himself in 1969 to guide Pauline Baynes in the elaboration of her _Map of Middle-earth,_ published as a poster a year later.
Also in 2015, Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull's book _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_ unveiled the writer's cartographic essays, preliminary to the composition of the maps published in 1954 in _The Lord of the Rings._
The new perspectives opened by these publications have given rise to exciting work in French, such as the studies by Simon Ayrinhac, published by the associations Tolkiendil and Le Dragon de Brume, while French-speaking readers appropriated the new translation of _The Lord of the Rings_ by Daniel Lauzon (2014), discovering a revised nomenclature and a new version of the map of the Shire ("le Comté") in French.
Finally, the major exhibitions dedicated to the writer and his work, in Oxford in 2018 and in Paris in 2019, shed light on new documents and clarified datings that had previously been vague.

The first version of my essay therefore deserved a serious update, both in terms of content and bibliographical references.

## Introduction

In the biography he devoted to J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter (1946--2005) reported a few words from him:[^turlin-shire-1] "If you're going to have a complicated story you must work to a map; otherwise you'll never make a map of it afterwards"
Respecting this principle to the letter, Tolkien accompanied the composition of his vast fictional literary universe with numerous maps that he made himself, or that he entrusted to his son Christopher, demonstrating to posterity his interest in geography and the importance it takes in his stories.
The best-known maps have accompanied the novels _The Hobbit_ (1937), _The Lord of the Rings_ (1954--1955), but also _The Silmarillion_ (1977), _Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth_ (1980), and more recently _The Children of Húrin_ (2007), in specific inserts or as fold-outs integrated into the book.
These maps are immediately identifiable and are an integral part of the book, as an object (cartography being an art practiced in Middle-earth), but also of the story, as an accompanying tool aimed at providing "a descriptive build-up,"[^turlin-shire-2] but sometimes intervening directly, by a beautiful _mise en abyme,_ in the course of the narrative.
They are both a fragment and a tool of the Tolkienian diegesis.
Subsequent editions of publications dedicated to the works of J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien have facilitated the release of further unpublished maps, frequently comprising the preliminary drafts of the iconic maps featured in his novels.
The study of this abundant and exceptional cartography, a particularly original element of Tolkien's literary art, would deserve a book in its own right, which would follow the excellent existing analyses.[^turlin-shire-3]
But I will not have the pretension here to tackle this task for which I have hardly any real skills.

Among the many Tolkienian maps, the one that retains my attention here is the famous map of the Shire.
Because of its specificity and its shift with the vast and wonderful spaces and the epic depth suggested by the large representations of Middle-earth, the modest map, partial (because it only deals with a "part of the Shire") and familiar (its toponyms are reported in a rustic but understandable English for the reader), deserves to be lingered over and explored step by step, without any pretension of achieving a perfect form of geographical hermeneutics.
We will focus on the preparatory maps that are part of its history.
The study of maps requires, however, adopting a certain methodology, inspired by specialists in the field, in order not to get lost along the way.
Most maps, from simple sketches to published maps, can thus lend themselves to an examination of the representations of their landform, watercourses, road networks, etc.

I will first briefly address the history of the map of the Shire and its elaboration, a history that is also a fragment of the history of the novel _The Lord of the Rings_ and of the relationship between a father and his son.
Then, in order to familiarize the reader with the imaginary landscapes, I will address some general data on the Shire.
I will then focus on a descriptive and critical inventory of the different known maps of the Shire and the stages of the restitution of the land of the Hobbits that were to lead to the famous published map, which I will analyze in more detail.
A detour through the multi-regional maps will allow us to restore the Shire in the geographical context of Middle-earth.
I will conclude this essay with an exploration of the possible sources of technical and aesthetic inspiration and an overview of the multiple extensions of the map of the Shire and its reappropriation on the margins and beyond the strictly literary aspect.

## A history of the mapping of the Shire

The young Rayner Unwin was not mistaken when, in 1936, at the age of ten, he was mandated by his publisher father, Stanley Unwin, to review the manuscript of _The Hobbit_ transmitted by J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien.
From his childish common sense, he noted the presence of the maps, sketches provided by the author with the manuscript, and assumed that they were sufficient to follow the story.[^turlin-shire-4]

Beyond this charming anecdote, we note that the maps were already part of the whole that was to become Tolkien's first novel.
According to the writer's own admission, the first version of the _Thrór's Map_ existed even before the composition of the manuscript.[^turlin-shire-5]
This detail reveals one of Tolkien's "narrative strategies," to use Vincent Ferré's expression,[^turlin-shire-6] which consists of considering the maps as a prerequisite with which to coordinate the plot in order to avoid any form of confusion.[^turlin-shire-7]
Following this principle, a summary map of Bilbo's country was established by Tolkien in the early months of 1938, even before a more general map of Middle-earth, to accompany the composition of the first chapters of the sequel to the novel _The Hobbit,_ a novel that was to become, as everyone knows, _The Lord of the Rings._
This map, published half a century later as a frontispiece in the book _The Return of the Shadow_ (1988), was the first of a series of about ten maps, drawn at various times between 1938 and 1954 by J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien for the oldest versions, then by his son Christopher for the most recent versions.[^turlin-shire-8]
The generally careful elaboration of these maps of the Shire, in parallel with those on a larger scale representing Middle-earth and systematically including the land of the Hobbits (but with less readability and precision), demonstrated Tolkien's attention to geographical detail.
It is also an interesting indicator of the evolution of the status of maps as the composition of the narrative progresses: at the outset, a simple support for the plot allowing a fairly framed rendering of the characters' journey, the map becomes an independent tool of the narrative.
It opens up imaginary spaces that are partially revealed to the reader by being out of reach of the story line.
The remark is even stronger for the multi-regional maps that reveal the immensity of their landscapes, while the narrative explores only a few tiny parts of them.

Tolkien considered that Christopher had more skills than he did to draw the maps.[^turlin-shire-9]
This was the reason why he entrusted him with the realization of some of them.

The most important of the representations of the Shire was apparently drawn in 1943, but it seems to have been interrupted during the summer when Christopher was forced to join, at the age of 18, a Royal Air Force training camp in Manchester to serve his country,[^turlin-shire-10] then at war with Germany and the Axis powers.

A few years later, on the eve of the publication of _The Lord of the Rings,_ Tolkien called on his son once again when he had to work on a map of the Shire to fit onto a single page.
The existing representations of the Hobbits' country did not seem to be suitable, and Tolkien did not feel able to carry out this exercise, which he left pending from April to October 1953, without finding a solution.[^turlin-shire-11]
Christopher therefore took charge of creating a large map of Middle-earth between the end of 1953 and March 1954, which included Bilbo and Frodo's homeland at the heart of Eriador, and a smaller map representing part of the Shire.[^turlin-shire-12]
These two maps, as well as a third one describing Gondor, were the ones finally chosen among the illustration documents included in the three volumes of _The Lord of the Rings_ published from July 1954 to October 1955.

The map of the Shire was very slightly retouched on the occasion of the release of a new edition of _The Lord of the Rings_ in 1966, but it was in 1994, on the occasion of the reissue of the novel by HarperCollins, that a new important step was taken.
The publishers, with the assent of Christopher Tolkien, called on the artist Stephen Raw to redraw the three maps of _The Lord of the Rings_ from the original drawings of Christopher Tolkien.
The new map of the Shire by Raw, quite close to that of 1954, thus became the one that still appears today in most English editions, with the exception of commemorative editions.[^turlin-shire-13] 

## The Shire, general data

This country, already partially traversed --- but without being named --- in the pages of the novel _The Hobbit_ in 1937, is thus presented again to the reader in 1954 in _The Lord of the Rings_ under the name of _the Shire_.[^turlin-shire-14]
And its cartography, although partial, is finally revealed.

This territory, which Tolkien estimated to be about 18,000 square miles,[^turlin-shire-15] is a region located in the heart of the vast region called Eriador, in the northwest of Middle-earth.
It brings together various geographical regions on both sides of the Great East Road, between the Far Downs to the west and the Baranduin (or Brandywine) River to the east, which form easily identifiable natural boundaries.
To the north and south, the boundaries are less precise.
Uncultivated moors, marshes, hills, or watercourses may have seemed to constitute, in Tolkien's idea, possible boundaries that could give a roughly circular shape to the Hobbits' country.

This fertile region, which is said to have been already occupied and exploited by the men of Arthedain long before the arrival of the Hobbits,[^turlin-shire-16] is artificially divided into four administrative Farthings oriented towards the cardinal points.
The Northfarthing is thus turned towards the north, the Westfarthing towards the west, and so on.[^turlin-shire-17]

In the variety of landscapes that make up these four parts of the Hobbits' country, some geographical features stand out.
It can be noted that large hill ranges dominate the Westfarthing: these are the Far Downs, the White Downs, Hobbiton Hill, and part of the Green Hills.

To the south, there are rather vast agricultural domains, probably shared between cereal fields, vineyards, and pipe-weed plantations: these are the fields of the Southfarthing.

The Northfarthing has forests, such as Bindbole Wood, moors, and high grassy lands, such as the Green Fields and the North Moors, but also cereal lands.

Finally, the Eastfarthing presents a combination of all these landscape motifs, with the eastern part of the Green Hills, Woody End, the cereal fields of the Yale, to which are added the marshy lands of the Marish, the Brandywine Valley, and a number of small watercourses that end their courses in the great river.

The Brandywine is the main river of the Shire and, as we have already seen, its eastern boundary.
The other important river in the country is the Water.
Its valley is at the heart of the Hobbits' territory.
On its banks, part of which is followed by the course of a major transregional road, the East Road, are the most important villages in the Shire: Frogmorton, Bywater, and Hobbiton.
Following the road in its course to the west, one can cross other large towns: Waymoot and Michel Delving on the White Downs.
The latter being the administrative capital of the Hobbit territory, the place where the Mayor of the Shire sits.

The toponyms of the Shire contrast with those of the Legendarium's cartography.
The latter mainly highlights names of territories, urban centers, and kingdoms from the Elvish languages --- mainly Sindarin --- imagined by J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien.[^turlin-shire-18]
In the large surroundings of the Hobbits' country, there are regions called Minhiriath and Harlindon, mountains designated by the name Ered Luin, rivers called Lhûn or Baranduin (renamed Brandywine by the Hobbits).
The Shire itself is located, as we have seen, in a region known in Sindarin as Eriador.
All these toponyms expressed in this Elvish language, even if they remain mysterious and indecipherable at first glance, bring great coherence to the geography outlined by the maps of the novels, from that of Middle-earth published in _The Lord of the Rings_ to that of Beleriand published a few years later in _The Silmarillion_ (1977).

This same desire for linguistic coherence is found in the map of the Shire but with a specificity that sets it apart from the great geography of the Legendarium.
Indeed, in the Hobbits' universe, topographic relief, hydrography, habitat, and forests are expressed in English in motivated names, that is, names whose meaning is easily intelligible to the reader, especially if the reader is an English speaker.

These names were for the most part chosen by Tolkien (with the help of his son) mainly from the rural landscapes of the West Midlands and Oxfordshire, both to represent a toponymy expressed in a common language specific to the northwest of Middle-earth, but also to give the Hobbits' universe a form of proximity to an idealized English countryside.

These linguistic choices bring great homogeneity to the map of the Shire.
They also give a certain plausibility and an appearance of authenticity to this document when the reader discovers it after the Prologue of _The Lord of the Rings_ and learns about this seemingly familiar territory before starting to read the first chapters of the novel.

Thus, the map of the Shire reveals, in a strange mise en abyme of a stylized drawing made by Christopher Tolkien, the representation of an imaginary territory that takes shape little by little as the reader explores it with the characters in action in the story.

The map published in the novel is only the culmination of a long family of documents, which I will try to list in the following list.


## The first known maps: descriptions & critiques

The maps of the Shire, representing all or part of the Hobbits' country, were drawn in limited numbers during the composition of _The Lord of the Rings._
Christopher Tolkien identifies six of them, of which he gives a brief description in the book _The Return of the Shadow._[^turlin-shire-19]
However, the book _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_[^turlin-shire-20] allows us to list four more.

Many common points mark all these maps.
The representation of geographical phenomena generally evokes --- but not always --- ancient cartography, with stylized bird's-eye views and false perspectives, as far as forests are concerned, and figurative motifs, for marshy areas.
The orography is either drawn in cavalier perspective or in contour lines.
The main roads are represented, as well as the main watercourses.
All the maps are read with an orientation from north to the top of the page.
However, some are very schematic, which can make them difficult to understand for those who are not familiar with the geography of the Shire.

For each of these maps inventoried, I will first give a summary of what geographers call "carto-bibliographical characteristics," that is to say a brief identity card, where should appear --- when these elements are known --- the designation of the map, its title, its author, the year of its creation and that of its publication.

I will approach this list with a Roman numbering in the chronological order proposed by Christopher Tolkien in _The Return of the Shadow._[^turlin-shire-21]
Quite arbitrarily, I will include in this list two of the maps redrawn by Stephen Raw in 1994, since they were made in cooperation with Christopher Tolkien, which is not the case for a number of other maps for which I will say a few words a little later (because they are no less important).

Since 2015, the work of Julien Mansencal and Vivien Stocker[^turlin-shire-22] and that of Simon Ayrinhac[^turlin-shire-23] have made it possible to establish a reliable correspondence between the list of Christopher Tolkien and the maps unveiled in _The Art of the Lord of Rings,_ numbered from 11 to 20.
We will therefore generally follow the chronological order determined in part by these works by applying this complementary numbering to the maps described in _The Return of the Shadow_ as well as to the unpublished maps.

{variant=SC}
: The Shire I / no.\ 11

   - Title: _Earliest map of the Shire_
   - Author: J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien
   - Creation: 1938
   - First publication: 1988 (in _The Return of the Shadow_).[^turlin-shire-24]


This map is obviously the first known realization of the Shire.
Tolkien sketched it in stages from the early months of 1938, to accompany, as we have mentioned, the writing of the story of the "new _Hobbit_".[^turlin-shire-25]
It represents a territory between the Barrow-downs to the east, the Bridgefields and Girdley Island to the north, the village of Hobbiton to the west, and the Overbourn Marshes to the south, thus overflowing the eastern borders of the Shire, as Tolkien must already have conceived them at the time.
However, it should be noted that he underlined most of the toponyms outside the Shire (including the site of Haysend, south of Buckland, from which one could deduce that at this point in the conception of the Hobbits' territory, it was outside the borders).

The map was first made in pencil and blue, red, and black pens.
Several indications initially marked in pencil were later retraced in black pen.
Others are now partially erased and difficult to read.
This is the case of the names of the families that Tolkien had associated with certain regions, such as the Bolgers or the Bracegirdles.[^turlin-shire-26]
Some toponyms can be reconstructed using our knowledge of the published maps, for example, the Bridge Fields, located here just south of the road near the Brandywine Bridge.
Others, for lack of later references, are indecipherable, such as the three-part name written in pencil at the very south of the Marish.
One can also observe very light lines drawn with a ruler, indicating that Tolkien had worked with a grid.
A method he systematically used later.


By its publication in 1988, this map has an undeniable historical value because it allows us to understand concretely Tolkien's "narrative strategy."
We can indeed follow on this document, on the one hand the route taken by the heroes of _The Lord of the Rings_ from Hobbiton Hill to Tom Bombadil's house and beyond by means of a series of dotted lines, and on the other hand, certain sites that were marked in pencil and then confirmed in black or blue pen later.
The back of the sheet used as a support for the map is annotated with a quick summary of the elements constituting the first chapters of the novel, as well as a primitive version of the family tree of the Took family.[^turlin-shire-27]

The sketch quality of this document and the altered state of some of the indications on it do not allow for a very fine analysis, but some elements still stand out.

The topographic relief (orography) is little represented on the map.
The Barrow-downs are schematized by rough prominences of various sizes and in blue.
The Tookland and the Green Hill Country, which we know from the text of the novel are very hilly territories, are only indicated by their names.
Hobbiton Hill seems to stand out as a remarkable site, so it is specifically schematized with rough black hatching that forms a circle.

The hydrographic network shows the Brandywine River drawn in the center of the map by a double blue line, while the secondary network, still in blue, is represented by a sinuous line accompanied by the name of the watercourse.[^turlin-shire-28]

The road network follows the same pattern: the main road, in red, is schematized by a double line, and the secondary roads by a bold line.

Like the topography, the wooded areas are poorly represented.
The Old Forest and Woody End (the latter located in several different places) are only distinguished by the toponymic annotations in blue that concern them.
A few figurative trees (always in blue ink) are drawn next to a crossed-out mention of Woody End, whose final location was apparently the subject of some hesitation on Tolkien's part.
Among the wooded elements, we can note the schematization of the Hedge of Buckland by a bold irregular dotted line that starts from the north (at the level of the Brandywine Bridge) and ends in a sinuous and rough line.

The habitat and the Hobbit settlements are represented in different ways: black dots for medium-sized towns (Hobbiton, Rushy), a single black dot for smaller villages or farms.
As an exception, an unusual blue square brings together Brandy Hall and Bucklebury, the main sites of Buckland.
The bridge over the Brandywine is represented by a double red line.

This very summary map nevertheless brings together many elements that are easily identifiable for the reader of _The Lord of the Rings._
It indicates, by its many annotations and corrections, that it was mainly a working tool for Tolkien.[^turlin-shire-29]

{variant=SC}
: The Shire II / no.\ 18

   - Title: _Map of the Shire_
   - Author: J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien
   - Creation: betw. 1938 and 1943
   - First publication: 2015 (in _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_).[^turlin-shire-30]


As Christopher Tolkien indicated in _The Return of the Shadow,_ the scale of this map is smaller than that of the Shire I.
It thus allows us to visualize a larger territory that extends from the Old Forest to the east to the Far Downs to the west.
It mainly presents the roads (drawn in red chalk), the rivers (in blue chalk), and a large number of toponyms rendered in pencil.
The relief areas are surrounded by a rough pencil line and identified by the corresponding oronyms (Far Downs, White Downs, Barrow-downs).
The only forest indicated is the Old Forest by the mention _Woody-end._
The habitat is not represented, but several names, sometimes difficult to decipher, are indicated: _Hill_ (for Hobbiton Hill), _Ovhill_ (for Overhill), _Byr_ or _Byw_ (for Bywater), Waymeet, Michel Delving, Little Delving, and Southburrows (an unpublished toponym, for a village located at the southern tip of the White Downs).
The Farthings are all indicated in capital letters.

The map is made in a style very close to the future map drawn by Christopher Tolkien and published in the novel in 1954.
It generally covers the same territories (with the exception of the western hills).
But it still looks a lot like map I / no.\ 11, forming a kind of transition between the two.
However, it features toponyms consolidated much later in the writing of the novel (Overhill[^turlin-shire-31] and Waymeet), as well as the precise and almost definitive delimitation of the Farthings.
These details encourage Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull to consider this map as a late production, shortly preceding the realization of the map published in the novel.[^turlin-shire-32]
It is thus not excluded that the Shire II described by Christopher Tolkien and map no.\ 18 of _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_ are ultimately two different maps, possibly made 15 years apart.
We leave the discussion open.

{variant=SC}
: The Shire III / no.\ 14

   - Title: _Map of the Shire_
   - Author: J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien
   - Creation: betw. 1938 and 1943
   - First publication: 2015 (in _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_).[^turlin-shire-33]


As with the Shire II / no.\ 18, which it follows chronologically if we rely on Christopher Tolkien's observations,[^turlin-shire-34] this map is mainly devoted to the representation of watercourses and the road network.
The scale is a little larger and allows to cover a more restricted territory between the Buckland Hedge to the east and the village of Michel Delving on the White Downs to the west.
On the other hand, the north and south, which had not been mentioned by Christopher Tolkien, are well represented.

To the north, the map follows the course of the Brandywine very far upstream.
We discover for the first time a tributary to the river.
It is not named, but we will find it in other maps under the name _Norbourn._

To the south, the map also follows the Brandywine far downstream, until the river meets one of the great roads of the Shire.
This time again, no toponyms, but we can easily determine that this meeting between the river and the road takes place at the Sarn Ford.

As with the Shire II / no.\ 18, the relief areas are surrounded by a rough pencil line, sometimes doubled to form contour lines.
Apart from the names of three of the Farthings, there are no toponyms.
It is thus difficult, at this stage of the creation of the Hobbits' country, to name the reliefs represented at the extreme north and south of the map.
The Green Hills and the Hills of Scary are easily recognizable, making their first appearance in the cartography of the Shire.

Christopher Tolkien did not specify the tools and colors used by his father to draw this map, but we can recognize the use of red pens (for roads), blue pens and pencils (for watercourses), and gray pencils (for the outlines of the reliefs and the preliminary drawing of certain roads, then retraced in red).

This representation of the Hobbits' country would have served, according to Christopher Tolkien, as a model for the Shire V (see _infra_).

{variant=SC}
: The Shire no.\ 12

   - Title: _Map of part of the Shire_
   - Author: J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien
   - Creation: betw. 1938 and 1943 (< August 1938?)
   - First publication: 2015 (in _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_).[^turlin-shire-35]


This small-scale map, which covers the same space represented in Shire III / no.\ 14, was mainly made in black ink.
It is not mentioned by Christopher Tolkien, probably because of its appearance of a hastily drawn sketch on an already handwritten copy.
It is nonetheless very interesting because it includes reflections on an unprecedented orography and toponyms that identify the northern and southern boundaries of the Hobbits' country.

The topography is therefore richly presented.
In the extreme north, contour lines drawn in ink represent the Hills of Evendim and the Northmoors.[^turlin-shire-36]
The two toponyms are written with the same ink.
To the far south, this time sketched in pencil, an imposing orographic ensemble is roughly drawn.
It is identified by two hastily sketched names: _Tarn na Donnrhyn_ and _Burntshrub Moors._[^turlin-shire-37]
The massif is probably located outside the boundaries of the Shire, both because of the presence of an Elvish toponym and because it seems to be located south of the Sarn Ford (represented by a double line across the course of the Brandywine River), which is generally recognized as an entry point to the south of the Hobbits' country.[^turlin-shire-38]
Three other orographic motifs are drawn but not named: the Green Hills (rough line in ink) and the Barrow-downs (succession of curves in pencil from west to east).
Far to the west, a light pencil line indicates the presence of the White Downs.

The hydrographic network is not accompanied by hydronyms.
It is represented by a long river that we guess to be the Brandywine (a thicker black line) and by three other watercourses (thinner black line).
There is the one to the north, already drawn in Shire III / no.\ 14; the one to the south, systematically represented since Shire I / no.\ 11, and which was then named _Shirewater,_ corrected to _Shirebourn_; and finally the one to the east of the Brandywine that crosses the forest (see _infra_ the wooded areas).
We identify this last one as the Withywindle River, already indicated in Shire I / no.\ 11.
A detail of the map catches the eye: it is the outline of a line in blue pencil (representing the Brandywine), which follows, to the right of the sheet, the same course as the representation in black ink, but taking a more marked turn to the north, as in the previous maps (Shire III / no.\ 14 in particular).
In the two representations of the river, Girdley Island is not named, but is easily recognizable.

The road network is represented by dotted lines.
We can recognize the East Road, as well as the departures of secondary roads.
These were obviously not the main subject of the map for Tolkien, but they were an undeniable landmark.
One of them leads to a small circle in the center of the map that is obviously the site of Bag-End.

The wooded areas are only represented by the Old Forest (unnamed) in green pencil.
This representation seems to overflow onto the western bank, but it was probably intended by Tolkien to indicate the presence of the Overbourn Marshes, already mentioned in the maps I / no.\ 11 and II / no.\ 18.
The Hedge of Buckland is represented by a black line.
A second curved line in pencil in the middle of the colored area could schematically represent the Hobbits' journey through the forest to the Withywindle.
The presence of this line and the lack of details beyond the Barrow-downs indicate that the map is probably older than August 1938.[^turlin-shire-39]

Despite its sketchy appearance, many details of this map no.\ 12 suggest that it may have been used by Tolkien in his reflection on the northern and southern boundaries of the Shire.
The elements it brings do not leave a lasting mark on the definitive narrative of the novel, and some of the toponyms will not be reused later.
But it is an important step in the search for verisimilitude and credibility brought to the ongoing narrative.

{variant=SC}
: The Shire no.\ 13

   - Title: _Map of the Westmarch_
   - Author: J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien
   - Creation: betw. 1938 and 1943 (< Dec. 1942?)
   - First publication: 2015 (in _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_).[^turlin-shire-40]


This map is a sketch of the Westmarch, the region located at the western edge of the Shire.
It was drawn on the back of map no.\ 12 and is even more sketchy.

Undoubtedly, it is a testimony to Tolkien's ongoing reflection on the (western) boundaries of the Shire.

Drawn very succinctly in blue ballpoint pen, it allows the identification of the Tower Hills on the left and the Far Downs on the right.
There are no toponyms, but a single mention scribbled in pen "Westmarch; not settled by Hobbits until about 14."
The mention of this territory does not argue in favor of a concomitant realization of map no.\ 12 and no.\ 13.
Indeed, the conception of the Westmarch came later in the author's writing (not before 1942).
But it could have been completed later, as Tolkien regularly returned to older drafts, as he did with his texts.

{variant=SC}
: The Shire no.\ 15

   - Title: _Map of the Shire_
   - Author: J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien
   - Creation: betw. 1938 and 1943 (> August 1938?)
   - First publication: 2015 (in _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_).[^turlin-shire-41]


Like maps no.\ 12 and no.\ 13, this sketch map is not mentioned by Christopher Tolkien.
Very busy and difficult to read, it seems to have been made in correspondence with map no.\ 13, of which it may be the eastern counterpart.[^turlin-shire-42]
Tolkien used mainly blue and red pens (the red has turned pink over time) and gray pencils (for the southern contour lines) and green (for the Old Forest).

Covering the same geographical area as Shire III / no.\ 14 and no.\ 12, this map goes from the Westfarthing to the Barrow-downs and from the Southfarthing to beyond the Northfarthing.

It has very few toponyms.
The Farthings are indicated by letters ("SF" for Southfarthing, "EF" for Eastfarthing), but it is mainly the presence of Norbourn, the name of the small northern river, finally designated, that catches the eye.
Far to the south, it seems that the name _Burntshrub_ is used to designate a group of hills, but it is difficult to decipher.

Geographical phenomena, such as erasures or corrections, are indiscriminately drawn in red, blue, or pencil (the orography is thus represented in the three colors), which makes reading this document quite difficult for those who are not used to the usual landmarks of the geography of the Shire.
This working map, very evolutionary and difficult to date, nevertheless allows us to identify the path of the four Hobbits from _The Lord of the Rings_ in the Barrow-downs (in red), while the hills are in blue contour lines.[^turlin-shire-43]
It also allows us to see that the southern course of the Brandywine was not yet completely fixed in Tolkien's mind, as he seems to have drawn a first trace in pencil, partially erased, then a second in blue pen,[^turlin-shire-44] like the two alternative traces of the northern course of the river, represented in map no.\ 12.

: The Shire no.\ 20

   - Title: _Map of the Branywine and Withywindle_
   - Author: J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien
   - Creation: 1939?
   - First publication: 2015 (in _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_).[^turlin-shire-45]


This black ink sketch, very minimalist, could be a new attempt at cartography corresponding to one of the rewriting phases of the first chapters of _The Lord of the Rings,_ as Christopher Tolkien describes them in _The Return of the Shadow._
It represents the courses of the two rivers Withywindle and Brandywine, the latter being drawn in an unprecedented way to the west rather than to the south.[^turlin-shire-46]
A dotted circle represents, _a priori,_ the heart of the Shire where the story of the first chapters of the novel takes place.
An irregular line to the east, oriented from north to south, is labeled "downs."
It could logically be the White Downs.

Difficult to date, this sketch map is unclassifiable.
It thus appears at the end of the inventories of representations of the Shire, both in _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_ and in the index of the maps of Tolkiendil.
For his part, Christopher Tolkien never mentioned it.
I propose to place it chronologically after Shire no.\ 15 and before Shire IV / no.\ 17 because it has many similarities with another summary cartographic scheme, which represents the south of the Misty Mountains and the course of the Anduin.
This map is described by Christopher Tolkien in _The Return of the Shadow._[^turlin-shire-47]

We can see that the trait between the two maps is roughly identical.
In addition to the fact that both are on the front and back of the same examination sheet, the pen used is also _a priori_ the same.
The writing is just as hasty, sometimes illegible, on both maps, which contrasts with Tolkien's usually careful work.
Another clue: Tolkien used the same dotted circular pattern on both drawings, one to identify the heart of the Shire, the other to represent the (then approximate) location of Fangorn Forest.
We can thus deduce that the two maps were drawn during the same period and are from the same phase of the novel's writing, i.e., the "phase three" in the middle of 1939, to use Christopher Tolkien's division.

The (approximate) geographical model of map no.\ 20 was later abandoned, but it was clearly part of Tolkien's hasty reflections on the environment in which his characters moved and indicates that despite their progress in the plot and in the paths of Middle-earth, Tolkien could at any time return to the imaginary geography of the Shire.

{variant=SC}
: The Shire IV / no.\ 17

   - Title: _Map of the Shire_
   - Author: J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien
   - Creation: betw. 1938 and 1943 (< Dec. 1942?)
   - First publication: 2015 (in _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_).[^turlin-shire-48]


This unfinished map represents only part of the Shire and overflows to the lands of the East, beyond the Brandywine River.
Its small scale allows it to represent the regions extending from the Bree-land to the east, to the Green Hill Country to the west.
In the brief description of this map, Christopher Tolkien omits to mention the northern and southern boundaries, which are well represented in the published map in _The Art of the Lord of the Rings._

Five toponyms appear on the drawing: Brandywine Bridge (in blue ink), Buckland (in purple ink), and further south, Sarn Ford (black ink).
The name of the river that is to become Shirebourn in the definitive version is still not fixed.
Here, we read _Snelbourn_ (in black ink).
One of the provisional names of this river, _Shirewater,_ finally fell to the small central river, which was simply called _Water_ in Shire I / no.\ 11 and which will take up this name in the published map.
There are no other identifiable toponyms on the map, but some difficult-to-read inscriptions (probably measurement and scale tests) are written in the margin of the drawing, outside a black ink frame that Tolkien took care to draw all around the most worked part of the map.
It was drawn with care in ink and partially colored with blue, red, and green pencils.

The topography is very represented with contour lines, finely drawn in ink in the central part of the map.
We can recognize the Green Hills, Hobbiton Hill, the Hills of Scary, the Barrow-downs, and --- for the first time on this series of maps --- the Bree-hill.
But the latter is partially outside the frame.
Further south, in a meander of the river, an unprecedented and unidentified orographic ensemble has been drawn.
At the extreme south, two parallel contour lines located west of the Sarn Ford could represent the Burntshrub Moors of maps 12 and 15.
Far to the north, other lines seem to represent the Hills of Evendim, while the Northmoors are not represented by any motif, unlike the previous maps dealing with the northern boundaries of the country.
We can also distinguish on the left of the sheet, outside the frame, three other orographic motifs located to the west and roughly represented in pencil, with a line light enough to make them practically invisible.
We can distinguish successively the White Downs, the Far Downs, and the Tower Hills.

The hydrographic network is drawn in blue pencil.
The Brandywine is represented (without being named) from north to south.
Its course is marked by the passage of the Brandywine Bridge (double line) and then that of the Sarn Ford (two double lines, probably a mistake by Tolkien).

Four other watercourses are drawn.
In addition to the Snelbourn to the south and the Shirewater in the center, we can recognize the Withywindle to the east in the forest, and the Norbourn to the north.

The road network is represented by continuous red lines.
The East Road is well represented and continues its course to the west, as well as to the east, outside the frame drawn by Tolkien.
There are also a few secondary roads.
The road from Bywater and the road that seems to be that of Little Delving (if we refer to the definitive map) are partially drawn, then the road to the Sarn Ford seems to be represented in its entirety (although the red line has probably faded over time) and crosses the entire Southfarthing to its meeting with the Brandywine.

The wooded areas are only represented by the Old Forest (unnamed) in green pencil.
This part of the map is the most precise, and Tolkien worked on it with care.
A few tree mounds in gray pencil show that he may have wanted to improve the aesthetics of his drawing.

The habitat is poorly represented.
It seems that the village of Hobbiton is indicated by small dots in ink, while two isolated points (if they are not ink stains that chance would have placed in the right place) could identify the sites of Frogmorton and Waymeet.

It should be noted that Tolkien represented the limits of the Southfarthing in dotted lines.
They merge with part of the course of the Snelbourn River.
The border between the East and West Farthings is, however, drawn in pencil with a light line.
It may be at this point that he stopped working on this document.
He did not take the time to clearly indicate the names of the Farthings, as he usually did on his preparatory maps (only the word Southfarthing, written in capitals in pencil and partially erased, is indicated).

Although Christopher Tolkien did not mention it, there may be a very indirect reference to the existence of this map in a letter to Stanley Unwin[^turlin-shire-49] in December 1942.
In this letter, his father expressed the need to include two maps with the possible publication of the imposing manuscript he had (that is, _The Lord of the Rings_).
Perhaps he began to carefully draw this map of the Shire with the idea of proposing it to Stanley Unwin, as he had already done with the maps of _The Hobbit_?
The other map in question seems to be a general map of the northwest of Middle-earth, drawn with the same care, tools, and codes as Shire IV / no.\ 17.
Spotted in the book _The Art of the Lord of the Rings_ by Simon Ayrinhac,[^turlin-shire-50] it makes it possible to restore the Shire and the surrounding hills in the broader geographical context of Middle-earth.

{variant=SC}
: The Shire V

   - No known title
   - Author: Christopher Tolkien
   - Date of creation: 1943
   - This map was never published.


Following the correspondence exchanges of December 1942 with Stanley Unwin, Tolkien certainly put the cartography of the universe of his novel back on the agenda.
The Shire IV / no.\ 17 map, we have seen, probably fits into this dynamic.

Several maps of different regions of Middle-earth were prepared at this time, and Tolkien enlisted the help of his son Christopher for these drawings, some of which remained unfinished due to his departure for the army in the summer of 1943.

For the new map of the Shire for which he was responsible, Christopher Tolkien adopted a large scale and drew inspiration from the existing map, using Shire III / no.\ 14 map as a model.[^turlin-shire-51]
The territory represented would then lie broadly between the Old Forest to the east and the White Downs to the west.
Although the northern limit of this map is not indicated by Christopher Tolkien (nor the southern limit), we know from the details provided by Hammond and Scull that several toponyms have been placed north of the Water.[^turlin-shire-52]
Most were not reused later on the map published in the novel, but a few toponyms maintained their own existence, such as the locality of Long Cleeve, which we know from the Appendices of _The Lord of the Rings_ is the homeland of Diamond, Peregrin Took's wife.
The presence of Long Cleeve on this map is therefore an indication of a fairly complete representation of the territories to the north of the Shire and the connivance of the document with the text of the novel being composed.
We can also deduce the presence of other toponyms to the north, such as the Norbourn River, the Northmoors, already mentioned on other older maps, but also why not the village of Hardbottle.[^turlin-shire-53]

Christopher Tolkien took care and detail in his work, using colored pencils and chalks.
It seems certain, although this has never been clearly stated, that this elaborate version served as a support for the famous map published eleven years later in the first volume of _The Lord of the Rings._

## The map of 1954

As we have seen, the best-known map of the Shire was drawn by Christopher before March 1954, in the fever that preceded, in the Tolkien family, the publication of _The Fellowship of the Ring,_ the first volume of the novel, on July 29, 1954.
I will now refer to it, continuing the numbering of the maps of the Hobbits' country and in connection with the publications of _The Art of the Lord of the Rings,_ under the designation of the Shire VI / no.\ 19.

{variant=SC}
: The Shire VI / no.\ 19

   - Title: _A Part of the Shire_
   - Author: Christopher Tolkien
   - Creation: March 1954
   - First publication: July 1954 (in _The Fellowship of the Ring_)[^turlin-shire-54]


Realized with care, although it has a number of defects, the famous map is offered to readers as a last run-up before diving into the novel (it is generally located in most editions between the Prologue and Chapter I).
It allows a decryption of a representation of a fictitious territory that is discovered through a literary description of imagination, and not in a context of real existence of the territory.
It invites the reader to a completely original escape-exploration, but which is limited to a territory between the Old Forest to the east, Bindbole Wood and the Hills of Scary to the north, the edge of the White Downs to the west, and the fields of the Southfarthing to the south.

Large areas of the Hobbits' country unfortunately remain off the map.
The opening of the road network to external territories, however, stimulates the imagination just as much.
The reader thus discovers the existence off the map of Longbottom, Dwaling, Oatbarton, or Little Delving, while Michel Delving, Bree, or the Sarn Ford allow him to stick this large-scale map back to the general map of Middle-earth,[^turlin-shire-55] also published in the novel, and thus to restore the modest Shire to a much larger geographical environment.

Originally drawn with black and red pens but regularly published in black and white since 1954, the map has a simple cartouche in the upper right corner where the title (in large and small capitals) and the initials "[c.t.]{.smallcaps}" for Christopher Tolkien are indicated.

The different elements of the organization of the landscape are easily identifiable, which probably explains the absence of a legend and a scale.

The topography is represented by two large orographic ensembles.
The first is located to the north of the map.
It is, by deduction from the reading of the novel, the Hills of Scary.
The second is more important.
A toponymic indication tells us that it is the Green Hills.
The motif used to represent the relief forms a series of irregular hills represented in a kind of cavalier perspective, with symbols alike those used in some maps of the 16th century, such as those made under the direction of Gerard Mercator.[^turlin-shire-56]
However, the brightness chosen for the drawing comes from the east and highlights a shadow area on the western slopes of the drawn peaks, unlike the old maps that prefer a setting sun (when they are oriented to the north) or a meridian light (for those oriented to the west).
Hobbiton Hill is represented in isolation but meets the same criteria as the large relief ensembles.

The hydrographic network is drawn with black and sinuous lines.
For the Brandywine, the line is thicker and is only interrupted by the passage under the bridge, represented in black by a double rectangular motif in planimetry.
The secondary rivers of the geographical area covered by the map are all represented.
The Norbourn River is located off the map.
The presence of islands (Girdley Island on the Brandywine and a large unnamed island on the course of the Water, which appears for the first time on a map of the Shire) is indicated by a doubling of the lines, while the Bywater Pool is represented in a flat area underlined with concentric curves.

The road network is represented by thick red lines.
However, in most editions, the map is in black and white, and the roads in black are distinguished from the lines chosen for the watercourses by a much less marked sinuosity.

Only the main roads are represented, and the network faithfully follows the schematic lines already precisely outlined in Shire II / no.\ 18 and Shire III / no.\ 14.

The road network is used by the cartographer to symbolically open his map to the outside, as I indicated a little earlier.
Some of the roads therefore leave the map and reach other places and other geographical spaces.

The wooded areas are well indicated, even if we guess that only large forest areas appear on the map.
They are represented by a mounding of figurative trees densely grouped in semi-perspective.
J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien had already used this style to represent Mirkwood Forest on the map of Wilderland published in the novel _The Hobbit_ (1937).

Wetlands are not systematically represented, but important marshes are symbolized by a scattering of stylized aquatic plants, sometimes difficult to read, due to the small size of the patterns chosen by Christopher Tolkien.

Apart from these wooded or wetland areas, there are no other symbols representing land use on this map of the Shire.
Agricultural or industrial data, for example, are only readable through the expression of toponymy.
Thus, the mention of the village of Oatbarton (off the map) suggests a cereal production, while Quarry may evoke the exploitation of building materials.[^turlin-shire-57]

The habitat seems sparsely populated, according to the map.
It is detailed in black planimetry, with sometimes confused and irregular patterns.

The freehand drawing of the map and the airy distribution of most of the toponyms contribute to the sobriety of the whole.
But the techniques, tools, and colors used by Christopher Tolkien probably added some constraints to the work of the printers.[^turlin-shire-58]
The final document shows some alterations that make some motifs of the representation of the habitat difficult to read or understand.
Sometimes, drawing defects, or smudges, which we do not know if they are on the original drawing, confuse the reader: how to interpret the thickness of the line on the course of the Water, just above Frogmorton, where the river forms an island?
The isolated planimetric motifs to the west of the map, along the East Road, are they representations of the "suburbs" of Michel Delving?
What about the situation of the village of Pincup, on the southern slope of the Green Hills, whose buildings seem to merge with the drawing of the trees, to the point that the first French version of the map in 1972 made this village disappear?
What is the nature of the isolated point that appears on some editions, under the toponym of Girdley Island?
What is the unnamed village represented by a group of planimetric symbols to the west of the Tookland, on the road to Longbottom? &c.

The toponymy used by Christopher Tolkien is of his own hand.
Sometimes round, sometimes in capitals, it seems to lack coherence: toponyms designating equivalent territories or localities are found in both types of transcription.
The capitalization would logically designate regions or villages of great importance, but this is not systematically the case.
For example, the Marish is in round, while the toponym Bridgefields is in capitals.
Similarly, the village of Frogmorton, a village whose importance is known,[^turlin-shire-59] is in round, while the village of Stock is in capitals.
The use of colors also lacks coherence: the most striking example is the choice of red capitals for Woody End, while Bindbole Wood is in black lowercase.
The marshy areas are in the same situation.

The transcription in round writing is sometimes insufficiently clear and does not allow a perfectly easy reading of several toponyms: this is precisely the case of Bindbole, which has often been read as _Bindbale,_[^turlin-shire-60] due to the poor reproduction of a poorly written "o" originally.
Haysend, Budge Ford, Thistle Brook, and others are also difficult to read, especially when the map is reproduced in a smaller format.
These difficulties may have caused some confusion for the translators responsible for adapting the map into other languages, as was the case in German and French.[^turlin-shire-61]

The names of the Farthings are written in large capitals in red oriented towards the cardinal points that concern them.
Thus, the name of the Northfarthing is written upside down, which is both original and confusing.

As we have already mentioned, the analysis of the map of the Shire VI / no.\ 19 does not provide exhaustive geographical information on the Hobbits' country.
It is indeed necessary for the reader who wishes to know more to cross-reference with the text of _The Lord of the Rings_ and those of other works, from _The Adventures of Tom Bombadil_ to _The Hobbit,_ through _Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth_ and some of the preparatory documents published in _History of Middle-earth._

The intertextual approach thus allows us to identify some slight confusions in the enumeration of distances[^turlin-shire-62] (especially as the map does not include a scale), or a disharmony between certain toponyms mentioned in the novel and those present on the map.[^turlin-shire-63]

But knowledge of these texts also allows the exploration of this "secondary world" to be extended and completed by giving a form of reality and consistency to the territory of the Hobbits, of which the map is only a representation.
It thus leads the reader to identify the existence of post relays on the East Road (at Whitfurrows, for example), but also the presence of a series of six inns distributed along this road, from the Brandywine Bridge to Hobbiton.
It also facilitates the discovery of the flourishing society of the Hobbits, who use the road network of their territory to multiply exchanges, to taste the southern wine in Bag End, to smoke Longbottom pipe-weed in the inns of Bywater, to cultivate the land while watching the companies of Dwarves pass along the East Road, and to meet at the Free Fair of Mid-year's Day in Michel Delving once a year.

{variant=SC}
: The Shire VI bis

   - Title: _A Part of the Shire_
   - Author: Christopher Tolkien
   - Creation: March 1954, corrected in 1966
   - First publication: 1966 (in the 2nd edition of _The Fellowship of the Ring_).


The discrepancies between the texts and the map raise the question of the predominance of the former over the latter and vice versa.
Where can certainty be found between two sources that both restore a perfectly imaginary whole?
Does the "narrative strategy" of the early composition, which favored the map as a starting point, still hold once the novel is finished and disseminated?

Tolkien eventually answered this question by imposing the primacy of the text over the map.

Thus, after the publication of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ in 1954, he noted several imperfections in map VI / 19 printed with the novel.
In a letter to the American publishing house Houghton Mifflin Company[^turlin-shire-64] in July 1965, he listed several of these defects, including the incorrect placements of Brandy Hall, Crickhollow, and the Bucklebury Ferry, which were placed too far north on the map compared to the description of the novel's text.[^turlin-shire-65]

But it seemed easier to correct the defects of the text than those of the map.
Consequently, Tolkien made an exception to his own rule by correcting in the novel in 1967 the mention of the Bucklebury Ferry located "to the east" (and no longer "to the southeast").[^turlin-shire-66]
Perhaps he was aware of being himself at the origin of the frequent changes in the position of Bucklebury and the Ferry from one map to another, as Christopher Tolkien later reported.[^turlin-shire-67]

Ultimately, despite the defects noted, only a few minor changes were made to the map on the occasion of the reissue of the novel in 1966.
There was first the addition of a black rectangle between the road from the Buckland and the Brandywine to represent Brandy Hall, while the tiny orographic motif originally intended to represent Buck Hill was removed (in accordance with the descriptions of the novel's text).
Then there was the addition of the toponym _The Yale,_ next to which a strange black point would have appeared during printing.[^turlin-shire-68]

With this black point that could have been confused later with the representation of a habitat (making The Yale a hamlet in the reader's mind, while it is indeed a separate region), other defects absent from Shire VI / no.\ 19 have been added, and now irregularly reappear from 1966, depending on the quality of the reprints: an isolated point south of Nobottle, the disappearance of a meander of the Water, just south of the Rushock Bog, and two mysterious points that appeared in the large meander of the Brandywine, south of the Overbourn Marshes and the Old Forest.

Moreover, by observing the road network, we note that the section of the Stock road that starts from Bywater to reach the Green Hills (although present on the Shire VI / no.\ 19 map and well described in the novel's text) is no longer represented from 1966.

Despite these few minor defects, this partially revised map was reused in all subsequent editions of _The Lord of the Rings._
It is now the best-known map of the Shire, the most generally accessible in online resources on the internet, but also its most _classic_ representation.

{variant=SC}
: The Shire VII

   - Title: _A Part of the Shire_
   - Author: Stephen Raw
   - Creation: 1994
   - First publication: 1994 (in _The Lord of the Rings_).


In 1993, as the project of an anniversary reissue of _The Lord of the Rings_ (the 40th anniversary of the first edition) approached, the publisher HarperCollins asked the American artist Stephen Raw to undertake, with the cooperation of Christopher Tolkien, a refreshment of the famous maps of the novel.
The objective of the project was to make them clearer, more readable, and adaptable to the different formats of editions.
As a result of the successive manipulations of the printers, the maps had indeed lost in quality and precision, especially in the pocket editions, where the two-color red and black format on a white background chosen for the original maps had been gradually abandoned for a simple black and white format.

Moreover, an alternative to the redrawn maps of the pocket versions of the American editions, which had become particularly dated, had become necessary.[^turlin-shire-69]

Stephen Raw then undertook to redraw the map of the Shire in a style particularly faithful to that of Christopher Tolkien.

Only the cartouche (the title is white on a black background), the calligraphic choice (a lettering of uncial or Roman capital letters, larger and more readable, but not always opportune[^turlin-shire-70]), and the planimetric representation of the villages (abstract and coarse, in the form of black squares) allow the map of Stephen Raw to be distinguished from the 1966 map.

Stephen Raw made some corrections: _Rushy_ became _Rushey_ and _Bindbale_ became _Bindbole._
The erroneous point in the Yale region disappeared, as did the small spots from the 1966 revision.
But _Waymoot_ was not corrected, although J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien seemed to prefer _Waymeet._
As for the road from Bywater, it seems to have definitively disappeared.[^turlin-shire-71]

In April 1994, this map was ready and approved by Christopher Tolkien and HarperCollins.
It therefore appears, along with a refreshed multiregional map and a new map of Gondor, in the 1994 anniversary edition.
Its quality having convinced all partners, it was subsequently reproduced in most of the standard English and American editions, becoming a new reference map.

## Multiregional maps

Pierre Jourde had the opportunity to point out in his work on _Géographies imaginaires_ (1991) that the territory of the Shire, of "closed and independent" appearance, is inscribed and balanced in the dependence of a larger geographical context.[^turlin-shire-72]
The adventures of the heroes of _The Lord of the Rings_ lead them on paths far from the green countryside of the Westfarthing.
And the multiregional maps, which are general representations of Middle-earth whose cartographic horizon far exceeds the boundaries of the Hobbits' country, facilitate the reader's follow-up of the characters' journey.

But these maps also make it possible to visually restore the Shire in its continental environment, as it is always represented there.

Some of the multiregional maps of the west of Middle-earth were drawn very early by Tolkien and have been as favorably editorially treated in recent years as the maps of the Shire.

Thus, _The First Map of The Lord of the Rings,_ made by J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien, was presented to the public in 1989 in the form of diagrams redrawn by Christopher Tolkien, to ensure better readability and understanding.[^turlin-shire-73]
The map was probably started as early as the first times of the writing of _The Lord of the Rings,_ to be constantly reworked at least until the end of the 1940s.
The Shire is already present on it, but in the simplest form, since only the toponym "The Shire," written in capitals, allows it to be located quite vaguely in a vast territory then called "Forodwaith," in reference to its northern location.
However, we can distinguish, by dotted lines in pen, indications of borders, to the south, to the east (separating the Old Forest, represented in green pencil and named on the map, from Buckland), and to the north (on the supposed course of the Norbourn River and to the south of the Hills of Evendim).

Christopher Tolkien seems to have redone this map later, but his version has not yet been published.[^turlin-shire-74]
On the other hand, other maps of Middle-earth including the Shire have been drawn by Tolkien.

As we have mentioned, the following map, _the Map of the northern part of Middle-earth,_ seems to have been drawn with the same care and the same tools as Shire IV / no.\ 17, and probably at the same time, perhaps around December 1942, when Tolkien considered that two maps, one of the Shire and one of Middle-earth, should accompany the narrative.[^turlin-shire-75]
In this large map, the Shire is drawn in detail.[^turlin-shire-76]
All the main tributaries of the Brandywine are represented, as are the main hills, except for Scary, and several toponyms are indicated: "The Shire" and "Westmarch" are written in red, while "Far Downs," "White Downs," and "Brandywine" are written in black.
The precise shape given to the Tower Hills and the Far Downs indicates that this map also has connections with the Shire map no.\ 13.

Like the map IV / no.\ 17, the care given initially to this multiregional map by Tolkien was later replaced by more messy annotations, indicating that it had become a working tool and no longer a map intended for possible publication.

Around 1948, new multiregional maps were drawn by Tolkien (probably helped by his son[^turlin-shire-77]), while the writing of the novel was coming to an end. Two maps of the northern and southern parts of the northwest of Middle-earth were drawn.
The one that interests us is mainly the first, also entitled _Map of the northern part of Middle-earth._[^turlin-shire-78]
The Shire is represented with less detail, the hills are drawn with irregular series of chevrons, and only the road and the great Brandywine River are clearly identifiable.
There are few toponyms: "The Shire," in red calligraphic letters, is of course indicated, as well as "R. Baranduin or Brandywine" for the river and "West-Farthing" for the western part of the Shire.
There is also the name "Br. Bridge" to identify the bridge over the Brandywine.

These 1948 maps probably later served as a basis for Christopher Tolkien to make the general map published in _The Lord of the Rings._
But before calling on his son's cartographic talent, Tolkien probably tried between April and November 1953 to redraw at least one general map himself, as he mentioned several times in his correspondence with his publisher.[^turlin-shire-79]
But he could not complete it, and all the maps were finally drawn by Christopher.

The famous _General Map of Middle-earth,_ also called _Map of The Lord of the Rings,_ is therefore one of the maps made by Christopher Tolkien, as well as the Shire map, and first published in _The Fellowship of the Ring_ in July 1954.

Leading the reader on the mysterious paths of an exciting fictional world, this multiregional map allows the exact location of the Hobbits' country to be determined, thanks in particular to the toponymic indications written in red letters.[^turlin-shire-80]
These are, from east to west, "Old Forest," "Brandywine Bridge," "Buckland," "Hobbiton," "The Shire," "Michel Delving on the White Downs," and "Far Downs."
The orographic and hydrographic representations are also precise enough for the reader to connect it to the Shire map he can consult at the beginning of the novel.
The Great East Road, indicated by dotted lines, is also a landmark that definitively facilitates the exercise, even if Christopher Tolkien himself was not completely satisfied with this representation of Middle-earth.[^turlin-shire-81]

In 1980, on the occasion of the publication of _Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth,_ Christopher Tolkien made a new map available to the public.
This is recentred and its scale is slightly larger than the 1954 map.
Several additional toponyms, often related to the stories presented in the collection, have been added.
But as far as the Shire is concerned, a simplification approach has been adopted to allow better readability.
The toponyms, arranged in a more airy way and with more careful writing, are then as follows: "Old Forest," "Brandywine Bridge," "The Shire," "Hobbiton," "Michel Delving," and "Far Downs."
The orographic and hydrographic representations have been reproduced with care to stick to those of the previous map, but shadow areas have been added to the hills (with light coming from the east), giving this part of the map a matutinal air and artistically more interesting relief, evoking a distant filiation with the style of Gerard Mercator, or those, more recent, of English cartographers such as John Seller, Herman Moll, and Robert Morden (late 17th to early 18th centuries).

The map _The West of Middle-earth,_ made by Stephen Raw for the 1994 HarperCollins edition (along with the Shire VII map), follows identically the aesthetic choices of the multiregional map of _Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth._
Thus, the orographic and hydrographic parts of the Shire are quite similar to those drawn in 1980 by Christopher Tolkien, but the toponymic part is slightly modified: we find "Old Forest," "Brandywine Bridge," "The Shire," "Hobbiton" (indicated by a black square), "White Downs," and "Far Downs."
These names are written in a script that is intended to be clearer and more readable than the previous maps.[^turlin-shire-82]

Because of the small scale, the representation of the Shire on the multiregional maps remains imprecise and has some discrepancies in the details of the rivers, roads, or the position of the hills.
But perhaps the role of these general maps of Middle-earth is not to be perfectly realistic or to provide a sufficient level of detail.
As Nicholas Tam points out,[^turlin-shire-83] the important thing is the plausibility and credibility of the fictional space for the reader.
The map is primarily a schematic object, intended to facilitate the understanding of a landscape.
Verisimilitude is not necessarily found in the level of detail, but in the complicity between the narrative and the map, and in the stimulation of the reader's imagination.

Moreover, Christopher Tolkien's aesthetic choices (and previously, those of Tolkien himself for the famous maps of _The Hobbit_) give the impression of drawing their inspiration from a much older cartographic tradition.
For the reader, this "antique style" reinforces the verisimilitude of the map of the Shire, whether general or regional, whether the scale is small or large.

## Regarding the possible sources of the map

Pierre Jourde had proposed to define an imaginary world as a "complex spatial set identified by toponyms mostly invented, provided that this set forms an autonomous structure clearly detached from the known and explored space at the time the author writes."[^turlin-shire-84]
If Middle-earth partly meets this definition, the homogeneous toponymy of the Shire and the origin of its inspiration, close to the real landscapes of rural England, put the imaginary geography of the Hobbits' country somewhat on the sidelines of the definition given.
The names of the places in the Shire are not specifically invented, as we have seen.
And the Shire, although fully part of the fictional universe of Middle-earth --- and yet intrinsically a fictional universe --- is not strictly speaking outside the "known and explored space" of our own world.

The inspiration for the Shire is now well known: in his various correspondences, Tolkien often expressed the indirect connivance, through toponyms, between the countryside inhabited by the Hobbits and the vision of an idealized England.[^turlin-shire-85]

Yet, the inspiration for the published maps themselves is more difficult to pinpoint.

As already mentioned, Tolkien himself admitted that Christopher had more skills than his father to draw the maps.[^turlin-shire-86] However we know that the academic studies of the young man were dedicated to ancient languages.[^turlin-shire-87]
Therefore, his knowledge and skills as a cartographer were very likely those of an autodidact.

It is difficult to establish with precision what may have been his inspiration for the realization of the published versions of the maps of the Shire and Middle-earth.
The general sobriety of his maps and the syncretism of the figurative elements (a combination of cavalier and stylized views for orography and vegetation, and representations in planimetry for villages) obviously make landmarks difficult for the observer, even if, as we have said, the impression of antiquity is well rendered by the assembly of these elements.

If the drawing of the orographic representations (essentially hills for the Shire map) can sometimes remind one of the style adopted in the 16th century by Gerard Mercator, this is not always the case.
The calligraphic choice for the toponyms is very personal (it is the writing, sometimes neat, sometimes not, of Christopher Tolkien himself) and is not related to any English cartographic tradition, contrary to what Stephen Raw may have tried to do (see note 70 _supra_).


![An excerpt from the West Midlands,\
_Grand Seurvey of England and Wales,_ sheet V,\
Gerard Mercator, around 1589, published in 1633.](images/turlin/map-extract-mercator-england.jpg){width="90%"}


The possible references of Christopher Tolkien's work on the Shire map could possibly be read from the side of the English classics of the 18th century,[^turlin-shire-88] although there is hardly any real resemblance between the canons of this cartography (which was contemporary with the French maps of the Academy of Sciences,[^turlin-shire-89] Cassini [iii]{.smallcaps}, and Louis Capitaine[^turlin-shire-90]) and the details of the Shire map.

Moreover, it is not certain that these old maps could have been part of the Tolkien father and son's study objects.

The so-called "boundary commissioners" maps, responsible for precisely establishing the boundaries between Wales and England around 1880-1885, seem more interesting because they have in common with the Shire map their great sobriety, as well as red border markings, a planimetric representation of the villages that resembles that used by Christopher Tolkien, and other striking details.
However, they were not widely disseminated to the general public and were essentially used only for administrative services at the time.[^turlin-shire-91]
Perhaps J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien could have had access to these already old documents in an academic setting? But what about Christopher?

The maps made by the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, which were published by series from the early 19th century until the Second World War, in black and white or color and at different scales, could have been possible sources of inspiration for Christopher Tolkien.
If there were not the burden of numerous topographical details (orographic stripes for the oldest, contour lines for the most recent, hydrography, parcel boundaries, secondary roads...) a certain familiarity with the 1954 map may seem perceptible.[^turlin-shire-92]
The major clue to remember is undoubtedly Christopher Tolkien's adoption of the conventional sign that appeared with these O. S. maps to represent the administrative boundaries of English counties (the same sign was adopted in France for the boundaries of prefectures), that is, a discontinuous line alternating dots and dashes, to represent the administrative boundaries of the Farthings.

One can also note that the conventional signs of these civil maps, as well as those adopted for military maps, may have been an inspiration for the preparatory maps drawn by J. R. R. Tolkien between 1938 and 1943.[^turlin-shire-93]

But in the end, none of this is obvious, and all of these reflections could quickly turn into wild speculation, as the testimony of Christopher Tolkien himself is missing to confirm or inform these hypotheses.

There is probably no interest in seeking a direct filiation, as it may not exist.
But the whole, and this is undoubtedly the _tour de force_ of the Shire map, is an original and personal work that undeniably carries a form of cartographic archaism, a delightfully antiquated impression.

This impression, combined with the inaccuracies of the map, contributes to the charm of the whole.
The reader can then be more easily transported into the world of Middle-earth.

## Multiple extensions...

Many admirers of Tolkien have understood the importance of the cartography of the Legendarium.
Tolkien himself had noted this and alluded to it in his correspondence.[^turlin-shire-94]
As I noted in the _Dictionnaire Tolkien,_ "the strength of Tolkien's narrative calls for illustration as much as it stimulates the imagination, and its visual dimension forms a fertile ground for a vast artistic creation."[^turlin-shire-95]
The rewriting of the maps, as an appropriation as much as an extension of exploration, is no exception to this phenomenon.

The first map of the Shire redrawn by a third party and distributed to the public was made in 1965 for the paperback edition of Ballantine Books.[^turlin-shire-96]
This map is part of the particular context of a showdown between Tolkien and his English publisher Allen & Unwin, and the New York publisher Ace Books.
The latter had published an unauthorized paperback edition of _The Lord of the Rings_ that had been very successful since the spring of 1965.
To counter this edition, Tolkien and Allen & Unwin had partnered with the American publisher Houghton Mifflin Company for an official reissue of the novel.[^turlin-shire-97]
The latter was a partner of Ballantine Books for a paperback edition in three volumes that was released in October 1965 with its famous maps probably redrawn by the New York artist Barbara Remington, who had also drawn the covers.[^turlin-shire-98]

Just like the large map of Middle-earth, also redrawn for this edition (the map made by Christopher Tolkien not being suitable for a pocket format), an effort was made to take up the major orographic ensembles, wooded areas, and hydrographic network of the Shire VI / no.\ 19.
However, the scales are not respected, especially for the road network and the planimetry used to locate the villages.
As for the psychedelic-inspired calligraphy chosen to highlight the toponyms, it appears today as dated as it is disproportionate.
Moreover, some errors (such as the use of _Bindbale Wood_ instead of _Bindbole Wood_) are found in this map.

A whole generation of American students seized on these maps from the Ballantine Books edition, emblematic of the 1960s and 1970s, which also marked, despite their flaws, their difference with the unauthorized Ace Books edition that had reused (without permission) the maps of Christopher Tolkien.[^turlin-shire-99]


![Excerpt from the American map of the Shire,\
Barbara Remington, Ballantine Books, 1965.](images/turlin/map-extract-remington-shire-upres.png){width="90%"}


Far from this famous example, other artists have reappropriated the representation of the Hobbits' country.

The illustrator Eric Fraser was thus entrusted in 1977 with the task of illustrating an edition of _The Lord of the Rings_ published by the Folio Society, by reusing some original illustrations by the Danish illustrator Ingahild Grathmer.[^turlin-shire-100]
Fraser seems to have redrawn (or contributed to redrawing) the three maps of the novel, although they are not signed.
They are generally printed on the inside cover and endpaper of these editions, in black and white, sometimes in blue and white, or printed in negative.

The map of the Shire of the Folio Society is rich in detail.
The topography is represented in black hatching patterns, and the forests in mounds of trees that extend beyond the contours drawn by Christopher Tolkien in 1954, to symbolize a very green land.
All the toponyms are present, there is no addition or surprise, except for the representation to the south of the village of Longbottom, at a supposed but unattested location, and the presence of a lake named "Lake Evendim" to the north, but whose size and geographical position at this point on the map are far from correct.

A general map of Middle-earth from this same edition correctly relocates the lake further north of the Shire.
It is well represented within Eriador, with the toponyms we are used to: "The Shire," "Far Dawns," "Westmarch," "Hobbiton," "Brandywine B.," and "Old Forest."

A little later, in 1981, Karen W. Fonstad made several maps of the Shire for a first edition of her imaginary geographical study: _The Atlas of Middle-earth._[^turlin-shire-101]
Her maps offer the advantage of extending the readability of the territory in a much more developed and complete way than the 1954 map, which only covered a "part of the Shire."
This is the case, for example, of the White Downs, the villages of Longbottom, Oatbarton, Long Cleeve, Gamwich, etc.
However, the lack of sources of this author led her to make choices of location, some of which seem manifestly erroneous.
Thus, the position of the village of Hardbottle, which she placed in the south, while Tolkien imagined it rather in the north of the Shire.[^turlin-shire-102]
She also repeated the error on the toponym _Bindbale Wood_ and could not represent the Norbourn River, of which she was unaware.

A second map, on a larger scale, allows the territory of the Hobbits to be placed in the context of the vast spaces of Eriador, with much more precision than is possible on Christopher Tolkien's multiregional maps.

Karen Fonstad, a trained geographer, managed to represent Middle-earth with a certain talent, using a two-color representation (black and brown on a white background) and effective drawings that contrast, however, with the aesthetic and archaic choices of Tolkienian cartography.
The reliefs are expressed in flat with detail and realism (in brown), wooded areas are represented by a pattern imitating trees (in gray), rivers are drawn by thin black lines, and roads are distinguished by their thick gray lines.
Villages are marked by small circles, and the writing is clear and legible.

In the same spirit and at the same time (1981 also), Barbara Strachey wanted to pay tribute to _The Lord of the Rings_ by making a series of simple maps representing Frodo's and his companions' journey.[^turlin-shire-103]
Her drawings, also made with care, contain, however, many errors.

The Shire is represented several times, in detailed maps showing the characters' journey from the novel.
The style of her representations strongly evokes the original map of the Shire VI / no.\ 19 in black and red.
The wooded areas form figurative trees grouped in semi-perspective (here too, the error on _Bindbale_ is found), the villages are represented in black planimetry.
The major difference concerns the topography, represented by contour lines.
In total, 9 maps by Barbara Strachey deal with the Hobbits' country or parts of their territory.
Two additional large-scale maps allow the Shire to be found at the heart of Eriador.

Fonstad and Strachey, very respectful of the work of J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien and his son, sought to correct the many _scientific_ imperfections of the cartography of the Legendarium (the question of scales, distances, and geographical recollations).
However, they made use of many questionable interpretations to achieve the desired level of detail for their maps.

Below the notoriety of these _historical_ cartographers, other artists have set aside the concern for geographical detail and the search for realism to stay as close as possible to the poetry and wonder that emanate from the map of the Shire.
Thus, in a style very different from that of the talented elders, but with an undeniable and respectful desire to pay tribute to Christopher Tolkien's map, the Frenchman Eric Faure-Brac made in 2005 a cavalier perspective (almost aerial) of the Shire, drawn with talent in English version to accompany the articles and documents published by the Tolkiendil association in its magazine _L'Arc et le Heaume._[^turlin-shire-104]
If the proportions and scales are not completely respected, this map, which is more of an illustration than pure cartography, is a success.

In the same spirit, your humble servant also attempted the delicate exercise of a representation of the Shire.[^turlin-shire-105]
This very imperfect map, in black and white, takes up the original toponymy and covers the entire territory of the Hobbits to its distant borders.
It strives to respect both the scales imposed by Christopher Tolkien in 1954 and the indications of J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien on distances in the novel.
The patterns used are borrowed from several types of maps from the 17th and 18th centuries.
An unpublished version of the map exists, corrected and expanded by me from the new data provided by recent publications.
As for the original work, it is unfortunately now out of print.

Other initiatives of this type have emerged in recent years among the Tolkien admirers' associations in England, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Italy, but also on the occasion of articles, essays, conference papers,[^turlin-shire-106] etc., and many personal visions of the Shire map exist today, made by as many admirers as talented, meticulous, and dedicated as they can be, and who are generally anonymous.[^turlin-shire-107]

Like the first-born maps of _The Lord of the Rings,_ the Hobbits' country is also represented on redrawn multiregional maps of Middle-earth by a number of illustrators.

The most famous is undoubtedly that of Pauline Baynes, made in 1969 in collaboration with J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien.[^turlin-shire-108]
Pleasantly and richly illustrated, this map highlights the Shire by the use of a readable uncial writing and the colorful representation of the reliefs.

Conversely, the Shire on the black and white map of Middle-earth by Shelly Shapiro for the American edition of _Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth_ in 1988 is not a success.[^turlin-shire-109]
The naive orographic representation and the general appearance of the map are far from the _canonical_ style inspired by Christopher Tolkien's work.

In some respects, the style chosen by Shelly Shapiro for her map brings her closer to another great colored map, less known, signed by Barbara Remington.
Made in 1965 for Ballantine Books in the wake of the black and white maps drawn for the paperback edition of _The Lord of the Rings,_ Barbara Remington's large map is as original as it is surprising.[^turlin-shire-110]
It offers those who have had the opportunity to contemplate it a loaded drawing, with reduced readability and a naive representation of the geography of Middle-earth.[^turlin-shire-111]

Finally, in the same line as the colored map by Pauline Baynes, the map made by John Howe in cooperation with Brian Sibley also highlights a Shire soberly represented, taking up but magnifying the _classic_ representation of the large and famous multiregional map published in _The Lord of the Rings_ in 1954.

Beyond these maps that are part of the tribute or continuity of Christopher Tolkien's work, many creations have accompanied the immense success of _The Lord of the Rings_ by seeking to rewrite the 1954 map.
A rewriting that aims to allow a different appropriation, an alternative reading of the Hobbits' territory and all of Middle-earth, a rediscovery that would go beyond the strict literary framework to address that of other media.

This is the case of the many and diverse maps produced for role-playing games, video games, or more recently, multiplayer online role-playing games.[^turlin-shire-112]
Of very variable quality, and often false, they take us away from the heart of my subject because they are inseparable from the playful manifestations they accompany.[^turlin-shire-113]

The maps made in the context of the film adaptations of _The Lord of the Rings_ by Peter Jackson (2001--2003) offer a different approach than that of the games.

The importance of the maps of the novel was indeed understood and skillfully exploited by the screenwriters.
Their evocative power as much as their function as a guide for the reader (here, the viewer) have been fully integrated into the cinematographic device and form one of the very few positive points of the adaptation of the novel.[^turlin-shire-114]

Daniel Reeve, the New Zealand artist who was entrusted with the task of making two maps of the Hobbits' country, made the choice, for the "large" map of the Shire (which is found in various formats for the needs of the many derivative products), to respect as much as possible the spirit of the 1954 map and its general style, with some slight modifications, notably in the hydrographic network, much more tortuous than that drawn by Christopher Tolkien, and in the layout of the orography.
We find indeed the black and red colors (the toponyms are written in a red calligraphy of uncial inspiration) but above all a colored and parchment background that adorns the map and gives it an antique look and a patina that is quite well thought out.
A second, smaller map, centered on the only elements of the landscapes of the Shire (the Old Forest is not represented there), is used fleetingly in Peter Jackson's films to represent an excerpt from the _Red Book of the Westmarch_ written by Bilbo.
This smaller map is artistically closer to the Shire map VI / no.\ 19 and participates in its own way in an interesting mise en abyme.[^turlin-shire-115]

But, like many cartographers of the Shire, Daniel Reeve mistakenly took up the toponym _Bindbale,_ thus inscribing himself in a kind of unconscious filiation and tradition.

## Towards a conclusion

The history of the Shire map could almost be read in a pyramid-like way.
Starting from the imagination of a single man, the result of a family, then editorial work, it is now the object of a collective appropriation by a huge readership, just like its big sister, the general map of Middle-earth.

The history of these maps, as Christopher Tolkien wrote,[^turlin-shire-116] is intertwined with the literary history of _The Lord of the Rings._
It participates in what Pierre Jourde could call a "total construction."[^turlin-shire-117]
Indeed, with its maps, the subtle intertextual links, the motivation of the toponyms, and the seductive association of precision and uncertainty, the imaginary geography of the Legendarium composed by J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien infuses its fictitious landscapes with airs of reality and objectivity.
This is perhaps more striking and palpable with the Shire map alone, as the links with a geographical and historical reality are readable.
By contributing to bringing such credibility to the universe of the novel, this map arouses, more than any other, the "secondary belief" and stimulates the reader's capacity for wonder.[^turlin-shire-118]

The conception of this cartography in literature has logically been abundantly taken up by the fantasy genre with similar codes: tight clusters of trees representing impenetrable forests, stylized orography for threatening hills and inaccessible mountains, calligraphies adapted to the tone of novels, etc.

But, as Pierre Jourde[^turlin-shire-119] and Nicholas Tam[^turlin-shire-120] have noted, the originality and strength of Tolkien's cartography lies in its evolution.
The Shire map, initially conceived of as a narrative support tool for the author, gains autonomy and reveals its own existence.
The map no longer "exists only in relation to the narrative,"[^turlin-shire-121] and the landscapes it reveals through figurative drawings are beyond the text and open onto the immensity of Middle-earth, then giving a glimpse of the evocative power of an imaginary geography.

## The Shire map in some foreign languages

The international success of _The Lord of the Rings_ obviously led to a cascade of translations.
About thirty, can be read in various sources.[^turlin-shire-122]
The first of these, the Dutch and Swedish versions, have been the subject of a number of criticisms from J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien.
This great specialist in Germanic languages took up this issue of translations and studied it at length.
He eventually resolved to write a guide for translators (called "the Nomenclature") to ensure a minimum of consistency.
This guide was one of the first posthumous publications edited by Christopher Tolkien.[^turlin-shire-123]

The translated maps, sometimes redrawn by anonymous graphic designers or renowned illustrators, admirers of Tolkien or not, are among the examples of the reappropriation of the Shire map by third parties.
Not all foreign editions of _The Lord of the Rings_ have necessarily made the choice to transform the map and its toponymy to ensure better readability for the local reader, but a number have proposed adaptations.
An arbitrary selection of a few European examples can present the different approaches.

### The Netherlands

The Dutch translation of _The Lord of the Rings_ (_In de ban van der Ring,_ 1957) by Max Schuchart (1920--2005) was extensively commented on by Tolkien.[^turlin-shire-124]

The map of the Shire was re-adapted by the illustrator Kees Kelfkens under the title _Een deel van de Gouw_ ("A Part of the Shire") for the Utrecht publisher Het Spectrum.
Overall, except for the road network marked by a double line and the addition of a scale expressed in miles, the map is, from the physical geographical point of view, very faithful to the original representation.
Kelfkens took his sources, since he had no other, in the Shire map VI / no.\ 19, before the 1966 modifications.
The logical result is the absence of the equivalent of Yale north of Woody End and the presence of a black mound supposed to represent Brandy Hall, east of the Buckland road.
The Bywater road is where it should be, and the cartographer took the initiative (a happy one) to add a scale that is as accurate as possible.

The translation was revised by Schuchart himself for a new edition of the novel in the Netherlands in 1997, but Kelfkens' map, of good quality, remained unchanged.


![Excerpt from _Een deel van de Gouw,_\
Kees Kelfkens, 1957.](images/turlin/map-extract-kelfkens-shire.png){width="90%"}


### Sweden

From December 1957, J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien expressed his concerns about the translation choices of the Swedish Åke Ohlmarks.[^turlin-shire-125]
In 1961, his concerns turned to anger.[^turlin-shire-126]
The bad mood was passed on to the next generation, as Christopher Tolkien long refused any new translation proposals to Swedish publishers until they could certify to him that Ohlmarks had been sidelined.
As a result of this atmosphere, there is little precise information about the first Swedish map of the Shire, apart from J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien's annoyed comments on his translation choices.

The second translation (by Eric Andersson) had to wait until the 21st century.[^turlin-shire-127]
It was an opportunity to review the original map of this Swedish version of the novel.
HarperCollins apparently persuaded its Scandinavian counterpart to respect the style of Stephen Raw's map.
The illustrator commissioned for the adaptation, Jan-Erik Hoglund, however, reworked the map, slightly arranging the calligraphy to improve the quality of the original map.[^turlin-shire-128]

Logically entitled _En del av Fylke_ ("A Part of the Shire") this Swedish representation of the Hobbits' country is included in _Ringarnas herre_ ("_The Lord of the Rings_"), published in 2004--2005 by the Norstedts publishing house.

### Italy

The fourth country to receive a translation of _The Lord of the Rings_ (after Poland in 1961), Italy, lacked a cohesive editorial policy for the adaptation of the Shire map.
It appears in the first edition of the Italian version of the novel (_Il Signore degli Anelli,_ Astrolabe-Ubaldini, 1967), with its adapted nomenclature.
But subsequent editions forget to integrate this map, which may seem quite surprising.
Only the general map remains from 1970 onwards, based on a translation by Quirino Principe.[^turlin-shire-129]
It is adorned with the famous "hand of Sauron" (with the Ring) extended over Rhovanion, a magnificent compass rose, and three coastal ships, both in the spirit of 18th-century sea charts and Pauline Baynes' map.
The part representing the Shire is, on the other hand, very rich in drawn details but poor in toponyms (some are misplaced, for lack of available space), no doubt to compensate for the absence of a dedicated map.

The Italians had to wait until 2003 to discover a new map of the Shire, made for the Milanese publishing house Bompiani by Francesco Bisaro.
Although supported by the _Società Tolkieniana Italiana,_ his map remains an artist's vision, oriented in cavalier perspective to the northeast, going as far as the Weathertop or Lake Nenuial.
It is also rich in drawn details but poor in toponyms (the main names --- exactly the same as those on Quirino Principe's map --- are written in large uncials and take up a lot of space).
Although very aesthetic and pleasant to explore, Bisaro's map remains little in conformity with Christopher Tolkien's map and ultimately brings nothing more to the reader than a beautiful illustration.[^turlin-shire-130]

The Bompiani editions, however, offer in 2020 and 2021 a new translation of the novel to the Italians, carried out by Ottavio Fatica.
The nomenclature of the Hobbits' country knows some important changes[^turlin-shire-131] and this time, an official map (_Una Parte della Contea_), based on Shire VI bis, offers a new setting for the toponyms of the country, which find their rightful place, but in Dante's language.

### Germany and Spain

The first German translation (by Margaret Carroux) dates from 1969, while the Spanish version had to wait until 1980.
In both cases, the nomenclature was acclimatized to the languages of the readers, and the Shire maps were adjusted accordingly.

The German map, _Ein teil des Auenlands_ ("A Part of the Shire"), generally follows Shire VI bis fairly closely (to the point that Christopher Tolkien's initials "[c.t.]{.smallcaps}" still appear on the cartouche).
The planimetric motifs representing the habitat have been slightly retouched for clarity.
The toponymy adapted in German is particularly rich, even if some errors or misunderstandings at the margin, due to the passage from one language to another, may persist.[^turlin-shire-132]
In 2000, the new translation by Wolfgang Krege took up most of the toponyms proposed by Margaret Carroux.
The map was therefore not modified, especially since the publisher (Klett-Cotta in Stuttgart) remained the same.

The Spanish map, entitled _Una parte de la Comarca_ ("A Part of the Shire"), generally follows Shire VI / no.\ 19 of 1954, including the location of the Bywater road or the absence of The Yale, slightly modifying the planimetric motifs representing the Hobbits' villages.
But unlike the German map, several names are not translated (Hobbiton, Scary, Oatbarton, and Dwaling, which are thus juxtaposed with Delagua, Las Tejoneras, and others) and the village of Nobottle does not appear on the map.

### France

Present in the first edition of _Le Seigneur des Anneaux_ (Christian Bourgois, 1972), the first French map of "_la_ Comté" redrawn from the Shire VI bis map with some adjustments, follows the toponymy translated by Francis Ledoux.
Although Tolkien's indications in his "Nomenclature" seem to have been generally followed by the translator (who may have had access to it at some point or another through his publisher), the same kind of concern as the Spanish map is found in the French adaptation: some names are not translated (Scary, Oatbarton, Dwaling, but also Stock, Standelf, Rushock, and Girdley) and others have disappeared (Pincup, Nobottle, Woodhall, and Budgeford), making this map very imperfect.

The proportions are nevertheless well respected, and the forest and orographic motifs, even redrawn, are in keeping with the spirit of Christopher Tolkien's map (with the shaded area on the western slopes of the hills).
However, unlike the latter, the roads are drawn with a double line, making them easier to distinguish from the watercourses.
The habitat is represented by groups of houses in semi-perspective, and the marshy areas are stylized with insistence.

Some errors from the Shire VI bis map are found in the French version, such as the _bourg du Val_ (adaptation of _The Yale_) which should not actually be a village, since the planimetric motif near _The Yale_ on the 1966 map is supposed to be a printing error.
Conversely, and quite paradoxically, as early as 1972, the Northfarthing wood is called by its real name, Bindbole Wood (and not _Bindbale_), but without being translated.
Yours truly has a certain attachment to this French map of the Shire, despite its flaws.
It was the map of discovery, the first step towards the enchanted exploration of the world of _The Lord of the Rings,_ before the dizzying immersion into the intricacies of the novel.
For me, rediscovering this old French map of the Shire is often what the French call a "Madeleine de Proust."

A second French map published with the novel was made by the cartoonist Philippe Munch for the Folio Junior pocket edition in 1988.
This representation, an artist's vision close to the standards of comics, has many scale, distance, village, wood, and hill positioning defects.
Most of the toponyms are taken from Francis Ledoux's translation, with the exception of _Soldur,_ which became Rushey again, and the _Val,_ which became Yale again (and without an accompanying blunder).
The village of Standelf has curiously become _Stadder,_ without anything to explain it...
Philippe Munch's map remains interesting, however, in this great panorama of the maps of the Hobbits' country, for its very figurative aspect, the quality of its drawing, and the originality of its approach, comparable to the map made in 2005 by Eric Faure-Brac.

In 2014--2015, Christian Bourgois published a new translation of _The Lord of the Rings_ by Daniel Lauzon.
A new map --- no longer of "la Comté" (feminine), but "du Comté" (masculine) --- was born.
Like the German map (and the last Italian map), it very faithfully follows Shire VI bis (including the initials "[c.t.]{.smallcaps}" on the cartouche) but the nomenclature in French is completely changed.
It is now perfectly consistent with that of _The Hobbit,_ which had never been the case for French editions until then.

See Hammond, Wayne G. & Scull, Christina, _The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion, op. cit.,_ p.\ 770: "[The Shire,] an area of about 18,000 square miles."

[^turlin-shire-16]: _The Lord of the Rings,_ Prologue: "the king had once had [...] vineyards, and woods."

[^turlin-shire-17]: This division imagined by Tolkien was an opportunity for him to have fun with the reader by using _farthing,_ a term usually used to designate a quarter of a penny (English currency). See Hammond, Wayne G. & Scull, Christina, _The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion, op. cit.,_ "Nomenclature," p.\ 770. But his inspiration may also come from the historical division of Iceland into four _landsfjórðungar_ (land-farthings) which was effective until a territorial reform in 1937.

[^turlin-shire-18]: Several toponyms of the territories under the control of Rohan (East/Westfold, the Wold...) form notable exceptions.

[^turlin-shire-25]: _The Return of the Shadow,_ p.\ 106.

[^turlin-shire-26]: _The Return of the Shadow,_ p.\ 284: "A few hobbit 'family territories' are marked on my father's map of the Shire [...] The Bracegirdles are placed west of Girdley Island in the Brandywine; the Bolgers south of the East Road and north of the Woody End; the Boffins north of Hobbiton Hill."

[^turlin-shire-27]: McIlwaine, Catherine, _Tolkien: Maker of Middle-Earth,_ _op. cit.,_ pp.\ 390, 392.

[^turlin-shire-28]: It should be noted that the small Girdley Island, on the Brandywine, is represented on this map.
It is still the case on the definitive map published in 1954. Similarly, the river that marks the southern border of the Shire was first called _Shirewater,_ but the name was crossed out in blue pen by Tolkien and replaced by _Shirebourn._

[^turlin-shire-29]: In his biography of Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter certainly refers to the Shire I / no.\ 11 when he writes in 1977: "In the end [Tolkien] handed over the job to his original map-maker, Christopher, who somehow managed to interpret his father's overlaid, altered, and often contradictory rough sketches [...]" (Carpenter, Humphrey, _J.\ R.\ R. Tolkien, A Biography, op. cit.,_ "A Big Risk").

[^turlin-shire-37]: _Tarn na Donnrhyn_ sounds Elvish, probably close in meaning to Burntshrub Moors. Cf. _donn_ < "dark (of colour)" (_The Etymologies,_ p.\ 355); _Tarn Felin,_ abandoned name for the Emyn Muil (_The Treason of Isengard,_ p.\ 424).

[^turlin-shire-43]: Detail of the map in _Art,_ p.\ 34.
The presence of this route allows us to determine that the map could be post-August 1938, when Tolkien was working on the chapters on Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-downs (cf. _Letters,_ no.\ 33 to C.\ A. Furth).
The correspondence of the Shire no.\ 15 with no.\ 13 suggests that Tolkien may have worked on this map until around 1942, when the concept of the Westmarch appeared in his writings.
Such a duration could explain the high number of erasures, the superimposition of drawings, and the different colors for equivalent geographical phenomena.

See also _Letters,_ no.\ 276 to Dick Plotz. Tolkien mentions in this letter to the "Thain of the Tolkien Society of America" a map of the Shire with more toponyms than the published map. He was probably referring to this 1943 map.

[^turlin-shire-53]: Hammond, Wayne G. & Scull, Christina, _The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion, op. cit.,_ "Nomenclature," p.\ 771: "Hardbottle. A place in the Shire; the home of the Bracegirdles in the North Farthing [...] meaning 'hard dwelling'; 'hard' because excavated in or built of stone (in the rocky Northfarthing)."

[^turlin-shire-61]: Thus, _Budge ford_ was rendered as "gué du pont" in the text of _The Lord of the Rings_ translated by Francis Ledoux, probably because _budge_ was understood as a bad transcription of _bridge_ (moreover, as a precaution, faced with the apparent contradiction between map and text, the toponym was removed from the map of the first French translation).
_Bindbole_ was adapted as _Schiefertonwald_ ("Slate Forest") by the German translator Margaret Carroux, due to a misunderstanding of the combination _bind-bale._

[^turlin-shire-62]: In _The Lord of the Rings,_ book I, ch.\ 5, Merry mentions a distance of 20 miles from the Bucklebury Ferry to the Brandywine Bridge. But a few lines earlier, this same distance is specified by the narrator to describe the length of the High Hay (Hedge) of Buckland. Moreover, in book VI, ch. 8, we learn that there is a distance of 18 miles between Bywater and Frogmorton. Checking these data on the map shows that Merry's assessment is incorrect and the distance from the ferry to the bridge should rather be estimated at 10 miles. Barbara Strachey thinks that Merry probably meant a round trip distance (Strachey, Barbara, _Journeys of Frodo..., op. cit.,_ map 6).

[^turlin-shire-63]: For instance, _Waymeet, Budgeford, Brockenbores_ in the text and _Waymoot, Budge Ford, Brockenborings_ on the map.

[^turlin-shire-64]: However, the Houghton Mifflin Company was to market a new edition of _The Lord of the Rings_ in partnership with Ballantine Books from October 1965 to counter the unauthorized publication of the Ace Books editions, which had been circulating since the spring of that year. See _infra_ the chapter devoted to "multiple extensions" and in particular note 97.

[^turlin-shire-68]: _The Return of the Shadow,_ p. 387, note 10.
For Christopher Tolkien, this is very likely a stain that appeared during the printing of the revised map.

[^turlin-shire-69]: See _infra_ the chapter devoted to "multiple extensions" and particularly notes 96 and 98.

[^turlin-shire-70]: A comparison with the typography of the English maps of the Ordnance Survey (O. S.), from the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, may suggest that Stephen Raw sought to approach a well-known cartographic style for the English.

[^turlin-shire-71]: Regarding _Waymeet/Waymoot,_ see Hammond, Wayne G. & Scull, Christina, _The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion, op. cit.,_ p.\ 660.
It is amusing to note that Christopher Tolkien's passage to Stephen Raw could be compared to the reproductions of old maps and their passage from one engraver to another: a new copperplate includes a few corrections, but reproduces certain errors from the previous copperplate and introduces new defects.

Through these letters, one can feel Tolkien's growing anxiety, unable to produce satisfactory maps, while the publisher's pressure increases over time. In this regard, one can feel his great relief when he  announces in March 1954 to Allen & Unwin that the proofs of the maps made by Christopher have been sent by mail (_Letters,_ 2023, no.\ 143a).

[^turlin-shire-80]: But in black in a very large number of editions.

[^turlin-shire-81]: See _Unfinished Tales,_ introduction: "for all its defects and oddities."

[^turlin-shire-82]: On some English editions from the early 90s, the 1980 Middle-earth map, in black and white, is poorly printed and simply unreadable.

[^turlin-shire-85]: This "idealized" England could correspond geographically to the surroundings of the town of Evesham, the landscapes of Worcestershire (in particular because of Sarehole and Rednal, the rural hamlets of Tolkien's childhood) and the territories covered by the Cotswolds hills (straddling 8 Shires, including Warwickshire, often cited by Tolkien), as well as the rural landscapes of Oxfordshire and Berkshire (see for example _Letters,_ no.\ 19, 178, 181, 190 or 276).

[^turlin-shire-86]: _Letters,_ no.\ 144 to Noami Mitchison. This does not prevent him, a few years later, from formulating very harsh criticisms of the 1954 map (_Letters,_ no.\ 274 to the Houghton Mifflin Company). Christopher Tolkien himself alludes to his father's criticisms of the general map of Middle-earth, see _Unfinished Tales,_ introduction: "However, as things turned out it became, for all its defects and oddities, 'the Map,' and my father himself always used it as a basis afterwards (while frequently noticing its inadequacies)."

[^turlin-shire-90]: Louis Capitaine (1749--1797) was a French engineer and cartographer who succeeded Cassini de Thury (Cassini [iii]{.smallcaps}) as head of the French Map in 1784. Initially associated with Jean-Dominique Cassini (Cassini [iv]{.smallcaps}) for the continuation of work on this map (known as the "Cassini" map), he produced a new large Map of France commissioned by the Constituent Assembly in 1790 but which was not published until 1822 for technical reasons --- Capitaine died prematurely, and it was another engineer named Belleyme who completed the work --- and administrative and political reasons.

[^turlin-shire-92]: Among the many O. S. map collections, those published by Alan Godfrey at the beginning of the 20th century may be the series closest to that produced by Christopher Tolkien for the Shire.
These maps were offered to the general public relatively early (compared to the French equivalent maps of the so-called "Orange" series, which were only marketed by the National Geographic Institute from 1976 onwards) and the Tolkien family probably owned one or more of them.
It is this model of map that Stephen Raw may have sought to approach for his own representation of the Shire in 1994.
Sally Bushell has also recognized the possible influence of these maps in Barbara Strachey's work (Bushell, Sally, _Reading and Mapping Fiction: Spatialising the Literary Text,_ Lancaster University, 2020).

This article, also available on the [Tolkiendil website](https://www.tolkiendil.com/tolkien/etudes/representation_cartographique), benefited from an update in 2023 in which Simon Ayrinhac highlights information from Stentor Danielson about Captain Solano's instruction book (1915) for English officers, which Second Lieutenant Tolkien could have benefited from during his military training or on the Somme front in 1916 (see Danielson, Stentor, "Military Cartography's Influence on Tolkien's Maps of Middle-earth," _The Journal of Tolkien Research,_ vol. 11, issue 2, 2020).

[^turlin-shire-94]: _Letters,_ no.\ 187 to H. Cotton Minchin: "many like you demand _maps,_ others wish for _geological_ indications rather than places."

"[_la force du récit_ \[_de Tolkien_\] _appelle l'illustration autant qu'elle stimule l'imagination et sa dimension visuelle forme un terreau propice à une vaste création artistique._]{lang=fr}"

[^turlin-shire-96]: In a way, the approach foreshadows the updating of the maps in 1994, with the difference that Tolkien was not fully involved, unlike the working collaboration between Stephen Raw and Christopher Tolkien which resulted in Shire VII.

[^turlin-shire-97]: See _Letters,_ no.\ 269, 270, 271 and 273. This pirate edition had been the pretext for a revision of _The Lord of the Rings_ in order to obtain publication rights in the United States and to stem the spread of unauthorized books, but it had, as a consequence, led to the revision of the Shire map that Tolkien found very faulty (_Letters,_ no.\ 274) and led to the realization of the Shire VI bis map. See _supra,_ note 62.

[^turlin-shire-98]: Tolkien had been afflicted by the covers drawn by Barbara Remington for an edition of _The Hobbit_ at Ballantine Books in 1965 (_Letters,_ no.\ 277 to Rayner Unwin). At the time of the realization of the drawings, she had not yet read the novel, for lack of time. Tolkien had not changed his mind for the covers of this edition of _The Lord of the Rings_ which took up the motifs of the _The Hobbit_ cover, and his negative opinion probably extended to the maps revisited by the artist. See also _infra,_ note 110.

[^turlin-shire-99]: Ace Books simply used Shire VI / no. 18, reprinted in black and white with no loss of quality. The general map of Middle-earth was also reproduced but cut into several parts to fit the pocket book format. Ace Books could have called on the artist Jack Gaughan (who had illustrated the covers and title pages of the three volumes of this edition) to redraw the maps. But this was not the case.

[^turlin-shire-109]: _Unfinished Tales,_ in the American edition, Ballantine Books, 1988.

[^turlin-shire-110]: Taking up the motifs of the covers of the Ballantine Books editions in a frame, this large map is quite comparable in style, quality, and scale to the one made a few years later by Pauline Baynes. However, Barbara Remington's very personal representation of the orography of the Shire and several errors in the positioning of many sites in Middle-earth did not bring the expected credibility to this little-known map (unlike the maps of the Ballantine Books pocket edition). Moreover, this artist, well known in the avant-garde circles of the East Village of the 60s, did not have Tolkien's favor. As we have already mentioned _supra,_ he had very harshly criticized her work for the cover of the American reissue of _The Hobbit_ at Ballantine Books in 1965.

[^turlin-shire-111]: The large map by Barbara Remington, if it may have inspired Shelly Shapiro later on, was not published (to my knowledge) for a long time, but only exhibited in galleries. Reproductions are now available for sale online. Barbara Remington died a few days after Christopher Tolkien, on January 23, 2020.

[^turlin-shire-112]: The most famous role-playing game map is undoubtedly the one made under the direction of Peter Fenlon for the _Middle-earth role playing_ (M.E.R.P.) game in 1984. But although this large general map covers many more regions than the classic maps of _The Lord of the Rings_ and cites toponyms as improbable as original (_Ruuriik, Ka Îsh, E-Sorul Sarc, Anyclax,_ and many others...), it is quite surprising to note that the Shire is not named among the territories represented. See Dauphragne, Antoine, "Jeux de rôles sur table et jeux de société" and "Jeux vidéo" in _Dictionnaire Tolkien, op. cit._

[^turlin-shire-113]: However, one can find nice surprises at the turn of a playful adaptation: the map of the Shire contained in the _The One Ring Starter Set_ of the second edition of the _The One Ring Roleplaying Game_ (Free League Publishing) is a real success. Although there are some errors (and lapses of taste), the whole is more than correct, and many details give a glimpse of the solid Tolkienian knowledge of the cartographer.

[^turlin-shire-114]: This last remark obviously only engages this author.
