This folder contains bibliographies some of the projects.

The bibliographies are organized by topic and are in BibTeX format, with some deviations by design:
 - Files are UTF-8 encoded (possibly inclunding reference keys)
 - There is no TeX-escaping of special characters and TeX-specific commands (i.e. no `{\relax ...}`, `\&`, etc.).

Currently, the bibliographies are focused on Tolkien-related essays, as part of the needs of Le Dragon de Brume.
