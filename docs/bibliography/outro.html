<p>In <em>Mythlore</em> 21 (4), Winter 1997, Nancy-Lou Patterson wrote: &ldquo;The list of works published by J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien in his lifetime is of moderate length, though posthumous publications have lengthened it considerably to some 25 or so. By my count the works of commentary and/or literary criticism have reached about forty, and are, to be generous, uneven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy-Lou Patterson&rsquo;s remark &mdash; that Tolkien criticism was &ldquo;to be generous, uneven&rdquo; &mdash; has aged remarkably well.
Since then, the field has not merely expanded but erupted: a surge of monographs, special issues, and conference tracks, fuelled by the Jackson films and the steady institutionalization of Tolkien studies.
Thematic range has broadened considerably, with new subfields exploring perspectives that were once peripheral &mdash; or absent altogether &mdash; from the discourse.
International participation has grown, and the conversation is more varied than ever.
Yet alongside rigorous scholarship, the familiar mix of the idiosyncratic and the underdeveloped persists.
The map is wider and more colourful, but the terrain remains recognizably the one <span class="nobreak">Patterson</span> surveyed: uneven, if now uneven on a grander scale.</p>
<p>While compiling this bibliography, I drifted through decades-old essays and early reviews, drawn beyond mere indexing.
Certain names lingered &mdash; fans who became scholars, some who found love, others whose voices have wandered beyond the Circles of the World.</p>
<p>Long before the internet, many of these publications seemed almost mythical to a French enthusiast.
Reading them now evokes a quiet intimacy, as if my younger self could sit among their authors, an unseen companion to their conversations across time.
Their words resonate like echoes, familiar and distant at once &mdash; a sensation that calls to mind Bioy Casares&rsquo; <em>The Invention of Morel.</em>
It is at once melancholic and strangely comforting.</p>
<p>For this feeling alone, the sometimes arduous work of compiling a bibliography feels entirely justified.</p>
