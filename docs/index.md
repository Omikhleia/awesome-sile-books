## Tools and sources for books and bibliographies

### Bibliographies

Most people landing on this page are probably interested in the latest generated web version of [A bibliography of Tolkien studies in French and English](bibliography/index.html).

People interested in browsing the source bibliography files and related scripts (or reporting issues etc.) may want to check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Omikhleia/awesome-sile-books).

Note that the bibliography is also distributed as a PDF booklet on Le Dragon de Brume's website, see [Bibliography of Tolkien studies in French and English](https://dragon-de-brume.org/bibliography/).
