# Wulfila's Gothic Bible

The Gothic Bible is the Christian Bible as translated by Wulfila in the fourth century into the Gothic language spoken by the Eastern Germanic tribes.

This book is an experimental (*and unfinished*) attempt at presenting a "modern" edition of Wulfila's Gothic Bible, typeset with the SILE typesetting system, from the XML edition of the Wulfila project ("An electronic edition of the Gothic Bible and minor fragments, based on Wilhelm Streitberg's 1919 edition", University of Antwerp, Belgium, 2004).

### Source material

The Wufila project is a research project of the University of Antwerp, Belgium, and the text is freely available for academic and non-commercial use. The principal researcher is Tom De Herdt, with help from Robert Tannert and David Landau.

This book wouldn't have been possible without the work of the Wulfila project, and the availability of the Gothic Bible in XML TEI format.

The text is typeset in the excellent "Ulfilas II" font designed by Dr. Robert Pfeffer, available for free only for non-commercial academic use.

### Booklet

The PDF booklet is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, Omikhleia.

Reproduction and/or distribution of the PDF or any derivative work in any form (including modified versions or printed copies) is allowed under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0, provided that the original source is clearly credited and that the work is not used for commercial purposes.

The core idea here is to show how SILE and the _re·sil·ient_ collection of modules were used to make that book a reality. It works as a "real-case" example, so that you may look at its sources and understand how we addressed our typesetting needs for that project.
